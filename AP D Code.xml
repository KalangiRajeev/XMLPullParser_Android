            Since independence and with the launching of plans, public expenditure have been
            mounting on a scale which has few parallels in the whole world. Government is
            increasingly assuming new functions and undertaking a wide variety of activities
            designed to respond to emerging social and economic needs. The phenomenal increase in
            Government activities will be evident from the fact that the Central and Slate budgets
            which were a mere Rs. 900 crores in 1950-51 are now well over Rs. 11,000 crores.
            According to increased functions of Public Works are broadly divided into Irrigation and
            Power, Roads and Buildings, Public Health, Panchayat Raj Engineering and Electricity
            Department. Each Department is headed by a Minister and the Executive Head of the
            Department is the Chief Engineer. The functions of the various departments mainly
            include construction of minor, medium and multipurpose river projects, construction and
            maintenance of non-residential and residential buildings and roads and bridges, public
            health, sanitation and water supply, rural development, construction of power projects
            and supply of power and execution of works on behalf of Central Government.

            When any officer or subordinate in the department is personally sued in only Civil
            Court, by parties claiming from him wages or money arising out of transactions in which
            he is concerned only in his official capacity and bonafide on behalf of Government, it
            will he necessary that he defends the suit by pleading that Government should be made
            the defendant as the party really interested. But when the suit is for damages in
            respect of an alleged wrongful act of a Government officer, the party aggrieved may, as
            a general rule, bring the suit against such officer, and it would be no defence for the
            officer sued to contend that Government ought to be the defendant. The plaintiff may
            legally contend that he has a right to look to the party by whose act he has been
            aggrieved, whether he could or could not have sued that party’s principal. The
            distinction is between suits on contracts and suits for wrongs. In cases of the latter
            kind, it will remain with Government to determine whether it would be just and proper
            that the defence should be carried on at the expense of Government. This course should
            ordinarily be adopted only in cases where there is no reasonable doubt of the innocence
            of the defendant. When, on the other hand, there is prima facie evidence that he has
            acted improperly, he should be left to conduct his own defence, the question of
            Government contributing towards the cost of the defence being subsequently considered.
            Whatever be the nature of the case, failure to defend the suit, or to reply to the
            plaint in person or by the counsel as the case may require, will render the officer or
            subordinate personally responsible.

            ‘original works’ and ‘repairs’, i.e., operations which are of the nature of both, e.g.,
            substitution of a terraced for tiled roofing, substitution of steel beams for damaged
            teak ones, dismantling and extending a veranda, etc. The classifications and treatment
            of such mixed estimates for the purpose of this Code will be determined by the
            principles in Para 93. Vide in this connection Explanatory Note 26(3) and (4) in

            When a portion of an existing structure is to be dismantled for the reason that it is
            structurally unsound, and is to be replaced by a work which is not in material essential
            the same as the work dismantled e.g., thatched roof replaced by tiled roof, or by an
            addition, e.g., an extension of a building, the mixed work shall, for the purpose of
            determining the authority competent to sanction it, be treated as an original work. In
            the estimate and in the accounts, the following points should, however, be observed—

            (a) If the new work costs more than the original cost of the work which it replaces, the
            whole cost should be first taken to original work but eventually the difference should
            be charged under ‘original works’ and the costs of dismantled portion under ‘repairs’.
            The costs of the dismantled portion should be taken as its original cost of construction
            plus the cost of any additions subsequently made, or where this is not known, its
            estimated cost.

            (b) If the new work does not cost more than the original cost of the dismantled portion,
            the difference between the two will be written off the capital accounts where they are
            kept, and the entire cost of the new work charged under repairs.

            Note 1 :— If an existing structure dismantled for the reason that it is structurally
            unsound is replaced by work which is in material essentials the same as the work
            dismantled, the work is strictly of the nature of repairs unless it falls under the last
            clause of Para 89. If a work is dismantled and replaced, not because it is structurally
            unsound but purely because of administrative reasons, the entire operation will be
            treated as an original work, and the whole cost debited to original works, the cost of
            the dismantled work being written off the ‘capital accounts’. The cost of dismantlement
            in either case should be charged to repairs.

            Note 2 :—The cost of restoration or special repairs shall not be added to capital cost
            or present value, unless such restoration or repairs add to accommodation or involve
            replacement of the existing type of work by work of a more expensive character.

            Illustration :— The cost of replacement of palmyra rafters by Karimarudu or of bamboo
            hurdling by teak wood reapers or of lime plastering by cement plastering should not be
            added to the capital cost of a building. The cost of deepening a well in order to
            restore the normal water-supply should not be added to the capital cost of a building
            but the cost of replacement of country tiles by Mangalore tiles, and of replacing a mud
            compound wall by a wall of brick in mortar plastered with cement and replacement of a
            cement floor by tiles should be dealt with in accordance with clauses (a) and (b) of
            this Paragraph.

            The following are the Rules and Conditions governing the execution of such works by the
            departments concerned :—

            (1) The construction of petty buildings and the execution of ordinary repairs to all
            civil buildings upto a limit of Rs. 5,000 shall ordinarily be undertaken by the
            departments using or requiring them, out of the funds placed at their disposal in the
            Civil budget.

            Note I :—The construction of new rain gauge pillars and the maintenance of rain gauges
            shall be undertaken by the departments for which they are intended, from funds allotted
            in the budgets of the respective departments. The officers of those departments may
            however at their discretion seek the advice of the P.W.D. officers.

            Note 2 :— When a building is occupied by more than one department, the ‘department’ for
            the purpose of the above Rule will be Revenue Department if it be one of the occupants,
            and if not, the Government department occupying the major portion of the building, to be
            decided in each case by the Superintending Engineer concerned. Petty internal repairs
            may, however, be carried out by, and at the cost of, the occupying department.

            Note 3 :— (i) In the case of works relating to Magistrate offices which are located in
            the same building as the Taluka office, the Revenue Department shall be deemed to be
            incharge of the whole building; administrative approval to such works shall be accorded
            by the officers of that department upto the limit of their powers, the expenditure being
            met from funds provided under “District Administration”.

            (ii) Works relating to Sub-Magistrates’ offices which are located separate or detached
            buildings, even though situated in the same compound with other buildings shall be
            deemed to be incharge of the Judicial Department; administrative approval to the
            proposal shall be accorded by that department upto the limit of their powers, the

            (2) When the works described in Rule (1) above involves structural alterations and
            additions to buildings in charge of the P.W.D., Civil officers should obtain the
            concurrence of the Executive Engineer to such alterations and additions and should also
            communicate to the Executive Engineer the actual cost incurred so that capital accounts
            of the buildings may be correctly maintained. While giving his concurrence to the
            proposals of Civil officers, the Executive Engineer should consider whether the work
            will require technical advice of a skilled nature or professional supervision and if so
            inform such officers that the necessary technical advice or assistance will be given by
            the P.W.D. officers during the course of construction and that for this purpose, timely
            intimation should be given of the date of commencement of the work.

            (3) When the works undertaken by Civil Officers do not involve structural alterations or
            additions to buildings incharge of the P.W.D., such officers should not requisition the
            services of officers of the P.W.D. unless in their opinion the works require technical
            advice of a skilled nature or professional supervision. The reasons for their reaching
            this opinion should in every case be communicated to the P.W.D. officer whose assistance
            is requisitioned. If, however, the P.W.D. officer is of opinion that the work does not
            require such skilled advice or professional supervision, he may return the requisition
            with full reasons for his opinion.

            Note :— All petty works of the Fisheries Department which require technical advice of a
            skilled nature and professional supervision should be executed by the P.W.D.
            irrespective of the cost of such works.

            (4) In the case of a building occupied partly by a district or taluk office along with
            one or more Government offices, the cost of the annual repairs should not exceed 11/2
            per cent or any other rate that may have been sanctioned on the capital cost of the
            building.

            (5) Rules (I) to (4) above do not apply to the following buildings the maintenance and
            repairs of which, irrespective of the cost, devolve on the P.W.D.

            should be consulted in case of doubt.

            Note 3 :—Gazetted Officers occupying Government residences are empowered to execute very
            urgent petty repairs such as the replacements of window-panes or stoppage of leaks
            subject to an upper limit of Rs. 20 annually (the actual amount being fixed by the heads

            The administration of all public works other than those assignees of the departments
            concerned under Paragraphs 95 to 97 above falls within the functions of the Public Works
            Department, but even such works may, by a mutual understanding between the P.W.D. and
            the department concerned, be executed by the latter on behalf of the former, the charges
            being debitable to the Public Works grants. In actual practice the system is confined
            mainly to— (1) Agency Tracts, (2) the Industries, and (3) the Agricultural Departments.
            In the case of(1) the arrangement is necessary on account of the inadequacy of the
            P.W.D. staff which is widely scattered and in the case of (2) and (3) the presence of
            departmental engineering staff renders the arrangements advantageous to both
            departments.

            Note 1 :— The heads of offices of the Agricultural Department are authorised to carry
            out, as Public Works Disbursers, ordinary and special repairs to residential buildings
            of the department borne on the registers of the Public Works Department subject to the
            conditions —

            (i) that the services of the Engineering staff of the Agricultural Department are
            secured when necessary;

            (ii) a statement is furnished to the Executive Engineers concerned from time to time
            showing the actual expenditure incurred on special repairs which would increase the
            capital value of the buildings so as to enable the Executive Engineers to regulate the
            rents of the buildings; and

            (iii) the heads of offices of the Agricultural Department should also forward to the
            Executive Engineers concerned—

            (a) a statement, after the close of the official year, of actual expenditure incurred on
            ordinary and special repairs to such buildings to enable the latter to prepare the
            capital and revenue accounts of residecets; and

            (b) an annual statement of the amounts spent by them on each building whether on
            ordinary or special repairs to enable the Roads and Buildings Department to keep a check
            on the amount and also to see that the buildings are not neglected for years together.

            Note 2 :—The Rules relating to minor irrigation works in charge of civil officers will
            be found in Paragraph 284.

            Note 3 :— The system should not be adopted in the case of jail works costing over Rs.
            5,000 which should be carried out by the Roads and Buildings Department. When, however,
            such works are executed by the contract system, jail labour should be employed by the
            contractors on all unskilled work connected with the contract as far as possible.
            Therefore when tenders are called for the work, it should be stipulated in the tender
            notice that the contractor should employ jail labour on all unskilled items of work
            connected with the contract, if such labour is available with the Jail Department and
            that jail labour if supplied, will be charged for at the rate of [x x x x] per man per
            day. A similar procedure should be adopted in regard to jail works executed
            departmentally by the Roads and Buildings Departments. In cases in which jail labour is
            not employed on a work for the reasons that the Jail Department is not able to supply
            it, a written statement from the Jail Superintendent to that effect should be obtained
            and recorded by the Roads and Buildings Department Officers.

            For every work proposed to be carried out, except petty works and repairs the cost of
            which does not exceed Rs. 2,500/- a detailed estimate must be prepared by the P.W.D. for
            the sanction of competent authority; this sanction is known as the technical sanction to
            the estimate. Except where definite provision is made in this Code to the contrary, such
            sanction can only be accorded by Government or, where powers has been delegated to them,
            by officers of that department. Sanction accorded to the construction of work by any
            other department of Government is merely an administrative approval of the work, which
            is in effect an order to the P.W.D. to execute a certain specified work for the
            department as a stated cost. (G.O.Ms. No. 50, P.W.D., Dt. 17—1—1966)

            It is waste of public money to prepare detailed plans and estimates for schemes for
            which the provisions of funds is unlikely to be made, and for this reason, in complying
            with requests from other departments for approximate estimates and preliminary plans for
            the purpose of administrative approval, only sketch plans and statements of probable
            costs (based in the case of buildings on cubic foot or plinth area rates) should be
            furnished by the P.W.D. On receipt of these, the requisitioning officer should take
            steps for obtaining the necessary administrative approval.

            Note 1 :— No approximate estimate is necessary when the total cost of a work is less
            than Rs. 5,000. In such cases a detailed estimate should be prepared in the first
            instance, provided the Executive Engineer is satisfied that the proposed work is
            necessary and is likely to be sanctioned.

            Note 2 :— Approximate estimates should be accompanied by a preliminary report, and such
            preliminary plans, information as to site, etc., as may be necessary to fully elucidate
            the proposals.

            Note 3 :— In the case of hospital schemes costing Rs. 50,000/- or more the following
            special procedure should be followed. Before approximate estimate and preliminary plans
            for such schemes are submitted to Government they will be scrutinized by a Committee
            consisting of the Superintendent, the Consulting Architect to Government, an officer of
            the Medical Department to be selected by the Superintendent and an Executive Engineer
            who has had considerable experience of the construction of buildings to be selected by
            the Chief Engineer. If the scheme relates to a mufassal hospital and personal inspection
            by a committee is considered necessary, the members of the committee visiting the site
            may draw travelling allowance. The plans should then be scrutinized by the Chief
            Engineer.

            The estimates which are submitted to Government for administrative approval or to

            up of the component parts and administrative sanction shall mention the financial break
            up, in respect of all such component parts also, to ensure that the amounts are not

            Note :— A similar procedure will be applicable for works required for the Public Works
            Department except that both the administrative approval and technical sanction will be
            accorded in the same department.

            On the receipt of administrative approval to works costing below Rs. 50,000, the P.W.D.
            should prepare detailed estimates and plans and after the professional authorities are
            satisfied that the proposals are structurally sound, the counter signature of the Head
            of the Department or of the local Head of the Department who applied for the execution
            of the work should be obtained to the plans and estimates in token of approval for
            Technical sanction should then be accorded.

            In the case of works costing Rs. 50,000/- and above, the procedure indicated below
            should be observed. As soon as possible after administrative approval is obtained to any
            such building scheme, detailed plans and estimates should be prepared with lump-sum
            provision for electrical and sanitary fittings. When the detailed plans are ready in a
            rough shape the Consulting Architect to Government should consult the Head of the
            Department who should in his turn obtain the advice of and circulate the plans to,
            experienced officers of his department. The Head of the Department should also consider
            specifically such points as layout and orientation of the buildings on the site with an
            eye on sanitation, water and electric supplies and the suitability and economy of
            arrangement of the building. The Consulting Architect to Government should ascertain the
            exact requirements from the Head of Department and incorporate them in the building
            plans which are then to be countersigned. Such approved plans countersigned by the Head
            of the Department should not be altered subsequently without the sanction of Government.
            As soon as the plans have been countersigned, the Executive Engineer should immediately
            proceed to obtain technical sanction communicating at the same time copies of the
            certified plans to the Electrical Engineer (General) and in cases in which the Sanitary
            Engineer has to be consulted, to the Sanitary Engineer also for further guidance in the
            preparation of detailed plans and estimates for electrical and sanitary
            installations—vide also Paragraph 255 of this Code.

            (i) If in the preparation of detailed technical estimates, it is found that the cost
            will exceed the amount administratively approved by more than the limits prescribed by
            the Government, from time to time for this purpose, viz., for sanctioning technical
            estimates in excess of administrative approval, revised administrative approval must be
            obtained before the technical sanction can be accorded. (G.O.Ms. No. 242, PWD., Dt.
            11—2—1966)

            [(ii) Revised administrative approval should also be obtained if the expenditure
            incurred has exceeded or is likely to exceed the amount of original administrative
            approval and the technical sanction by more than the limits prescribed by the Government
            from time to time or when material developments of deviations occur]. (Subs. G.O.Ms.No.
            1582, PWD, (Y), Dt. 18—9—1970).

            Explanation to Para 102 :— According to the orders issued in G.O.Ms.No. 242, PWD., dated
            11—2—1966 amending Para 102 of the A.P.P.W.D. Code, among other things, revised
            administrative approval should be obtained if the expenditure incurred exceeds the
            amount of technical sanction by more than the limits prescribed by the Government from
            time to time for passing such excesses by the appropriate authority. The Accountant
            General, Andhra Pradesh has sought clarification whether revised administrative approval
            is necessary even if the expenditure incurred is less than the original amount
            administratively approved, if it exceeds the amount of the technical sanction by more
            than the limits prescribed for passing such excesses by appropriate authority.

            A question also has arisen whether the revised estimates should be compared with
            original administrative sanction or the original technical sanction.

            The Government have carefully examined the above two issues. According to Para 102 of
            the A.P.P.W.D. Code as amended in the Government Order referred to above, revised
            administrative approval is necessary if the expenditure incurred exceeds the amount of
            technical sanctions i.e., original technical sanction. But the officers could revise the
            technical estimate, if the works are not completed for any amount within the amount of
            administrative sanction plus such excess upto which they are competent to accord
            technical sanction. Obtaining revised estimate in such a case becomes purposeless. Since
            the officers are empowered to pass excesses during execution over the technically
            sanctioned estimates, the Government consider that revised administrative approval
            should be obtained if the expenditure incurred has exceeded or is likely to exceed the
            amount of original administrative approval and the technical sanction by more than the
            limits prescribed by Government from time to time. Accordingly, the amendment to Para
            102 of the A.P.P.W.D. Code is issued.

            The Chief Engineers are informed that the revised estimate should be compared with both
            the original administrative approval and the original technical sanction for the purpose
            of determining the necessity to obtain revised administrative approval. For the purpose
            of determining the necessity to obtained revised technical estimate as indicated under
            Para 214 of the A.P.P.W.D. Code, the comparison should be with the original technical
            standing only.

            under the proper sub-head of ‘Repairs’.

            the preparation of a detailed estimate, provided that the cost is not likely to exceed
            Rs. 2,500/-.

            (iv) Should the budget grant under the particular sub-head be insufficient to meet the
            outlay, reference must be made to the Superintending Engineer.

            (v) When the approximate estimate exceeds Rs. 2,500/- a detailed estimate must be framed

            The papers to be submitted with the project for a work will consist of a report, a
            specification and a detailed statement of measurements, quantities and rates, with an
            abstract showing the total estimated cost in rupees only of each item. These documents
            form what is called the estimate in the sense of this Code. The form of the abstract
            will depend on the method proposed for the execution of the work. If it is intended to
            purchase or supply materials and to employ labour for construction separately (whether
            by contract or departmental agency), the abstract of the estimate should be so framed as
            to show separately for each distinct item of artificer’s work (1) the cost and quantity
            of “labour”, and (2) the cost of materials. But if this is not the case, e.g., when any
            item of work is to be executed by contract and it is proposed to contract for the
            completed items of work, the abstract of the estimate may show merely the quantity and
            cost of each item of work. In the case of a project consisting of several works, the
            report may be a single document for all the work and likewise the specification, but
            details of measurements and abstracts may conveniently be prepared for each work,
            supplemented by a general abstract bringing the whole together. In the case of estimates
            for ‘Repairs or ‘Maintenance’, only the specification and the detailed statement of
            measurements and quantities with the abstract will ordinarily be required. The report
            should state clearly the purpose of the work estimated for, and explain any
            peculiarities which require elucidation including where necessary, the reasons for
            adoption of the estimated project or design preference to others.

            To facilitate the preparation of estimates, a schedule of rates of each kind of work

            for materials or for labour. In the data accompanying the schedule of rates for works,

            All incidental expenditure which can be foreseen such as compensation for or cost of
            land, sheds for workmen and stores, should be separately provided for in the estimates.
            The provision for contingencies should not be diverted to any new work or repair which
            is not provided for in the estimate and of which the cost exceeds Rs. 2,500. without the
            sanction of the Superintending Engineer vide also Para 428 (c). The provision for petty

            Note :—The percentage of the provision for petty supervision and contingencies to be

            prescribing a scale for petty supervision and contingencies in the estimates for works
            of the Public Works Department (Irrigation Branch and Roads and Buildings). These orders
            were extended to the Electricity Department also. The Accountant General, Andhra Pradesh
            suggested that if the orders are to be made permanent, the minima prescribed in respect
            of works of the Nagarjuna Sagar and Srisailam Projects may be kept in view while
            amending the A.P.P.W. ‘D’ Code. The Chief Engineer (Major Irrigation and General) has
            proposed, with reference to a decision of the Committee of Chief Engineers that in
            addition to the minima, provision of 5 percent in the estimates costing upto Rs. 10,000
            prescribed in respect of works of the Nagarjuna Sagar and Srisailam Project may be
            adopted in the Public Works Department (Irrigation Branch) and (Roads and Buildings) as
            against 4 percent prescribed in the GO. first read above.

            After careful consideration, the Government approved the proposal of the Chief Engineer
            (Major Irrigation and General). The consequential amendment to Para 117 of the A.P.P.W.

            usually of the same quantity from time to time, such as the painting or whitewashing of
            a building, or a new coating of metal on a road;

            (ii) other occasional petty repairs which may become necessary from time to time, and
            which may have to be carried out between the times of periodical repairs;

            (i) Special repairs are other than ordinary repairs, i.e., they are repairs which are
            not periodical or frequent, e.g., re-roofing a building, replacing of beams, renewal of
            flooring, etc. whenever a work of special or ordinary repairs is accompanied by
            improvements or extensions, the rule in Paragraph 93 for classifying the work should be
            observed.

            (ii) In respect of irrigation works, special repairs include all operations required to
            maintain the work in a better condition, i.e., to an improved standard by using material
            of a more permanent or lasting nature without increasing the efficiency or scope of the
            system, e.g., cement plastering or pointing in place of ordinary plastering or pointing,
            plastering in place of pointing, roughstone masonry in place of dry stone packing,
            revetment to tank bunds at sites of breaches and to margins of rivers at places where
            they are eroded, grouting newly the surface of the aprons and revetments, lengthening of
            aprons and revetments to protect erosions noticed in beds and margins of rivers, canals
            and channels. Whenever a work of special or ordinary repairs is accompanied by
            improvements or extensions, the rule in Paragraph 379(c) for classifying the works
            should be observed.

            [(iii) In respect of works undertaken by the Roads and Buildings department “Special
            Repairs” include all operations of road embankments, eroded margins of road, and
            approaches to bridges, e.g., improvements to revetments of road embankments, restoring
            the eroded margins of a road or protecting them with revetment etc., vide also
            instructions in the exceptions to Rules 4 and 5 under Explanatory Note 26 of Appendix 4

            by improvements or extensions, the rule in Para 93 of the A.P.P.W. D. Code for
            classifying the works should be observed]. [Added by G.O.Ms. No. 1171, PWD, Dt.

            [Except in the case of lumpsum estimates for ordinary repairs, dealt with under
            Paragraph 147, the annual expenditure on ordinary repairs to Government buildings (both
            residential and non-residential) exclusive of municipal taxes, should be limited to
            maximum of 3 ½ per cent of capital cost. In applying this limit to residential
            buildings, the capital cost of all residences in each circle will be taken into account
            and within the total amount so arrived at, it will be permissible to incur upto 4 ½ per
            cent for building which are over two decades old and 2 ½ % for buildings which are less
            than two decades old. If, in any year, the expenditure on ordinary repairs to the
            Government buildings in a circle exceeds the limit of 3½ per cent, the sanction of the
            Superintending Engineer should be accorded for incurring the excess expenditure]. [Subs.

            As regards special repairs, as defined in Paragraph 134, no limit has been fixed with
            reference to the capital cost of any building, as such repairs are not annual or
            strictly periodical. Such estimates should be carefully scrutinized and sanctioned by
            the competent authority as occasions arise.

            the cost of sites and land appurtenant thereto but includes the cost of sanitary and
            water- supply installations.

            Note 2 :—The limit of 3 ½ percent on the capital cost laid down in the above Paragraph

            The Executive Engineer and the Electrical Engineer (General) may incur expenditure on
            the maintenance of electrical installations in Government buildings upto a limit of 3 ½
            per cent of the capital cost of the installations without reference to higher
            authorities. In special cases, in which expenditure in excess of the above limit has to
            be incurred, the sanction of the higher authority, viz., the Superintending Engineer or
            the Chief Engineer, as the case may be, should be obtained to the excess expenditure.

            In the case of residential buildings, the provision for repairs to the electrical
            installations may be included in the lumpsum provision to be fixed under Paragraph 147,
            of the A.P. Public Works Department Code, this particular item of expenditure being
            exhibited in the expenditure schedules separately as in the case of “Rates and Taxes”
            for purposes of accounts.

            In the case of the installations in non-residential buildings, a consolidated estimate
            for all the electric installation in each sub-division should be prepared and
            sanctioned.

            A separate working estimate should be sanctioned to cover the expenditure incurred on
            account of the cost of the establishment employed to look after the installations in
            both residential and nonresidential buildings including special plant and machinery
            therein and the expenditure may be distributed annually to the estimates of the several

            GO. 1st read above, wherein the limit of expenditure was fixed on plinth area basis at
            Rs. 1.20 per sq. ft.

            2. The need for proper maintenance of hospital buildings as well as educational
            institutions has been pointed out from time to time by the concerned departments. The
            Chief Engineer (Buildings) has also requested for the upward revision of the maintenance
            norms for proper upkeep of Government buildings and reported that the CPWD has been
            adopting different norms for Offices, Hospitals and Schools. While in the case of
            Offices, the maintenance norm is Rs. 1.60 per sq. ft., it is Rs. 2.20 per sq. ft. for
            Schools and Hostels and Rs. 3.00 per sq. ft. for Hospitals. He has, therefore, requested
            the Government to enhance the maintenance norms based on the CPWD norms.

            3. The Government after careful consideration of the proposal of Chief Engineer
            (Buildings) have decided that a revised set of norms based on CPWD norms should be
            adopted by the State Government as indicated in the following paragraphs.

            If the cost of ordinary annual repairs, excluding the municipal taxes to a building
            (residential or non-residential) is less than Rs. 1,000 the Superintending Engineer may
            prescribe, subject to revision from time to time, a lump-sum limited to Rs. 1,000 (plus
            the amount of the municipal taxes, if any payable by Government under Paragraph 250) to
            cover the cost of ordinary annual repairs and within this amount, expenditure will be
            permissible year after year without any detailed estimate being prepared. The Executive
            Engineer enjoys similar power upto a limit of Rs. 500 for each building. Such lump-sum
            estimates should be framed after a consideration of the cost of maintenance in the past
            and is not subject to the 1 per cent limit under Paragraph 144 except in the case of
            residential buildings. If, in any working year, this estimated cost of ordinary repairs
            is more than the permissible limit given above, or if the lump-sum sanctioned by the
            Superintending of Executive Engineer is exceeded, a detailed estimate should be
            prepared, in accordance with the ordinary rules and sanctioned by the competent
            authority. On sanction being accorded to such an estimate, the sanctioned lump sum
            estimate would automatically be superseded for the working year in question.

            Similarly lumpsum estimates may also be prepared and sanctioned for ordinary repairs to
            floating plant based on a five-year limit of expenditure subject to the following
            conditions :—

            In the case of staff boats or steamers for which proforma accounts are maintained
            individually for each plant, the expenditure on any one plant in any years together with
            the expenditure on that plant in the previous four-year should not exceed the five-year
            limit to be fixed. In the case of other minor floating plant, a single lump-sum estimate
            based on a five-year limit to be fixed may be sanctioned for the repair of all floating
            plant included in a class and the total expenditure for any one year on all the plant in
            any one class should not exceed one-fifth of the five-year limit fixed for that class.

            Electrical Maintenance Works

            Similar lumpsum estimates may also be prepared and sanctioned for ordinary repairs to
            electrical installations in civil buildings. Where the cost of such annual ordinary
            repairs is less than Rs. 2,000, the Chief Engineer (Roads and Buildings) may prescribe,
            subject to revision from time to time, a lumpsum limited to Rs. 2,000/- to cover the
            cost of annual maintenance of electric installations in civil buildings. The Electrical
            Engineer (General) may similarly prescribe lumpsums up to a limit of Rs. 500/-. Within
            this amount the expenditure will be permissible year after year without any detailed
            estimates being prepared and when the above limits are exceeded in any working year
            detailed estimates will have to be prepared in accordance with the ordinary rules and
            got sanctioned by the competent authority.

            Note — The sanction accorded to lumpsum provision referred to in the Paragraph should be
            held to be a sanction for an estimate for the amount of lumpsum for all purposes of this
            Code.

        <para_desc>

            The works executed by the department are carried out by one of the under- mentioned
            three methods. Lumpsum form of contract is to be adopted for contracts exceeding Rs.
            20,000. If not, prior approval of the next authority is necessary, but Chief Engineer
            has got full powers :— [G.O.Ms.No. 859, PWD., Dt. 30-4-1970j

            (i) departmentally, by the employment of daily labour,

            (ii) by piece-work agreement in form Public Works Department V-51, and

            (iii) by an agreement in form Public Works Department V-53, based on a lumpsum tender
            system, as defined in the Andhra Pradesh Detailed Standard Specifications.

            Method (i) is adopted in cases where no contractors are available or where, for other
            reasons, it is found more economical. Under this method, the department manufactures or
            purchases its own materials. The purchase of materials or tools and plant and machinery
            is governed by the store rules in Appendix 15 to the A.P. Financial and Accounts Code
            (Volume II).

            [Under Method (ii), the piece-worker merely agrees to execute a specified work at
            specified rates without reference to quantity or time. The conditions of the contract
            add the security to be taken from the piece-workers for the due fulfilment of the
            contract are set forth in form Public Works Department, V-51. The piece-worker usually
            possesses little professional knowledge or capital and employs no supervising staff. The
            department arranges for the supervision, the setting out and the measuring of all work.
            The piece work system shall ordinarily be confined to works costing not more than Rs.
            25,000. Rupees One lakh for construction or repair works and Rupees Five labs for
            transport works. If, any case of improvements and repairs costing above Rs. 2,500 it is
            considered preferable to adopt the piece-work system instead of Method (ii) reasons
            therefor should be recorded in the relevant file. The schedule of rates in the
            piece-work agreement should show the rates either for finished work or for labour and
            material, as the case may be, even for items for which lumpsum have been provided in the
            sanctioned estimates]. [Amended by G.O.Ms. No. 1007, Tr.R. and B., Dt. 5-11-1976]

            In regard to Method (iii), the details are set forth clearly in—

            (1) the Preliminary Specification of the A.P. Detailed Standard Specifications;

            (2) the standardized forms of articles of agreement, tender notice and tender mentioned
            in the A.P. Detailed Standard Specifications [Public Works Department Form Nos. V-53(a)
            and 53(b) respectively), and

            (3) the intermediate and the final bill-forms connected therewith [Public Works
            Department Forms Nos. VI-75(a) and 75(b)].

            In the case of each work executed under Method (ii) or Method (iii), the authority
            accepting the contract will decide whether it is desirable to retain, in the hands of
            the department, the supply of imported stores or other materials.

            In cases where it is decided that the department should supply certain materials to the
            contractor for use on the work, a description of every such materials and the rate and
            place at which it will be supplied should be specified in the notice calling for tenders
            and also in the schedule forming part of the agreement — vile also Paragraph 327, A.P.
            Public Works Accounts Code.

            In cases where the contractors are allowed to supply the required imported articles
            themselves, the description of such articles must be clearly defined by governing
            specifications. For cases where the “British Standard Specifications” standards are not
            applicable, other suitable methods should be adopted, such as, specifying the catalogue
            number product of a reputable firm. When test certificates are demanded, full
            particulars shall be given in the tender notice and the agreement and it shall also be
            stated therein that the cost of furnishing such certificates shall be borne by the
            contractors.

            Before a work is given out on contract, the authority competent to accept the contract
            must prepare “contract documents” to include—

            (i) a complete set of drawings showing the general dimensions of the proposed work and
            so far as necessary details of the various parts-works to be done under lumpsum items in
            the schedule to the agreement should be clearly defined by specifications or drawings,
            as necessary.

            (ii) a complete specification of the work to be done and of the materials to be used,
            unless reference can be made to specifications contained in the A.P. Detailed Standard
            Specifications and its Addenda Volume — (in the case of the items of work for which
            there are already standard specifications, the numbers of the relevant specifications of
            the A.P. Detailed Standard Specifications should be referred to in the schedule attached
            to the agreement).

            Note — Items (i) and (ii) above are necessary for both piece-work contracts and
            contracts based on the lumpsum tender system.

            (iii) a schedule of the quantities of the various descriptions of work. (This is
            necessary only in the case of contracts based on the lumpsum tender system as defined in
            the A.P. Detailed Standard Specifications. In such a case, the total under the Schedule
            A of the agreement must be equal to the lumpsum entered in the agreement), and

            (iv) a set of “conditions of contracts” to amplify as necessary the preliminary and
            other specifications of the A.P. Detailed Standard Specifications forming part of
            contracts based on the lumpsum tender system; (in the case of piece-work contracts, the
            conditions considered necessary for any particular case in addition to those printed in
            Form PWD V— 51 should be attached to the agreement).

            they may be modified to suit the requirements of any particular case, or for works of
            great magnitude, after consultation with the legal advisers of the Government. In cases

            contractors, who have not deposited a lumpsum of standing security deposit of Rs. 1.00
            lakh with the Chief Engineer, concerned, and 1 per cent only subject to a maximum of
            Rs.75,000/— in the case of Contractors who have deposited a lumpsum of standing security
            deposit of Rs. 1.00 lakh with the Chief Engineer concerned]. [Sub. by G.O.Ms.No. 4710,

            Note :—Minor Irrigation works in Telangana area under the administrative control of P.W.
            Department entrusted to the ayacutdars for execution are exempt from the collection of
            earnest money deposit.

            (iv) With whom or what authority, the acceptance of the contract will rest.

            No tender should be accepted from a person who has been or who has in his employ, a
            person who has been in the Gazetted Service of Government in any capacity, and has
            retired within a period of two years prior to the date of tender, except in cases where
            the officer concerned has obtained specific sanction of Government to do so prior to the
            date of tendering. Such tender, if accepted, because such information has not been
            furnished by the tenderer, shall be cancelled when the fact of such tendering comes to
            the notice of the tender accepting authority. (G.O.Ms.No. 1845, PWD, Dt. 8—9—1963)

            Authority should always be reserved to reject any, or all, of the tenders so received
            without the assignment of a reason, and this should be expressly stated in the
            advertisement.

            In the case of works to be given on contract based on the lumpsum tender, as defined in
            the Andhra Pradesh Standard Specifications, the forms of tender notice and tender
            (standardized as P.W.D. Forms No. V—53(a) and 53(b) should be used with such
            modifications as any particular work may require.

            No tender should be accepted from any person directly or indirectly connected with the
            Government service — vide Paragraph 72 of this Code.

            The Executive Engineer or the Superintending Engineer, as the case may be, should open
            the tenders in the presence of the tenderers or their authorized agents who may choose
            to be present at the time. The officer opening the tenders should invariably date and
            initial not only the corrections in the schedule of quantities, schedule of materials to
            be issued, specifications and other essential parts of contract documents but should
            invariably date and initial all the pages of the tender documents irrespective of
            whether they contain or do not contain any corrections, overwritings, etc. If there are
            corrections in the tender unattested by the tenderer, a note of such corrections should
            be made on the tender itself, when it is opened — vide Paragraph 9 of the Standard
            Tender Notice PWD Form No.15(a). The Officer opening the tenders should keep a personal
            note of the total number of tenders opened by him and verify therewith the number in the
            comparative statement of tenders.

            Tenders should be decided within a period of one/two/three months after the expiry of
            last date prescribed for the receipt of the tenders by the Executive
            Engineer/Superintending Engineer/Chief Engineer respectively and the decision regarding
            the disposal of tenders should be indicated at any time within the said period.

            During the above mentioned period no plea by the tenderer for any sort of modifications
            of the tender based upon or arising out of any alleged misunderstanding or misconception
            or mistake or for any reason be entertained. (G.O.Ms.No. 271, PWD, Dt. 20—2—1970)

            Acceptance of tenders — correction of rates in tenders — Instructions — Issued.

            [Memo.No. 136/CQD/80—1, I.and P. (P9 Dept., Dt. 1 9—2—1980]

            Ref :—Govt.Memo.No. l6—Y/72—4, PWD, Dt. 13—3—1972.

            Order :—Certain general institutions have been issued through the Govt. Memo. referred
            to above regarding the acceptance of tenders. A question has raised whether, after
            opening of tenders if any contractor makes a representation regarding an error that has
            crept through oversight or inadvertence if any of the rates quoted by him, the revision
            requested for could be taken into account in evaluating the tender.

            Government after careful consideration are of the view that by the very nature of
            submission made by the tenderer and the facts of the case, it should be possible for the
            tender deciding authority to ascertain whether it is a case of genuine error out of
            sheer oversight or inadvertence or it is a case of deliberate attempt to under bid in
            the first instance and being lowest try to gain advantage by enhancing the rate still
            below the next higher tender. This can be done by a comparison of the rate quoted with
            the estimated rate and the rates bid by other tenders for the item in view. In the
            former case (Oversight or inadvertence) the bid should be corrected according to the
            request of the bidder and evaluated for further consideration. In the latter case the
            tender should be summarily rejected and! or such action taken against the tenderer as is
            permissible under the conditions of the bid or the rules of Registration of Contractors.

            After the receipt of the comparative statement and before the selection of a tenderer,
            the officer concerned should examine all the tenders and satisfy himself that no
            corrections which were not in that tenders at the time he received them had been made in
            any of them.

            Note 1 :—Tenders should invariably be called for when the amount involved in a
            particular contract is [Rs. 5,000/-] or more. If it is proposed, in any case whether for
            urgency or any other reasons to be recorded, to depart from the rule, works may be
            entrusted on nomination at rates not exceeding estimate rates by the Executive Engineer,
            Superintending Engineer or Chief Engineer upto the following limits indicated against
            each.

            Executive Engineer Rs. 10,000

            Superintending Engineer Rs. 25,000

            Chief Engineer Rs. 50,000

            When tenders are dispensed with in the case of contracts exceeding Rs. 20,000 a report
            should be made by the officer entrusting the work on nomination to the next higher
            authority indicating the reasons for dispensing with the tenders. When the amount
            involved is less than [Rs. 5,000/-] the Executive Engineer may call for tenders or not
            at his discretion. [Inst. by G.O.Ms.No. 361, Tr, R and B. (B.I) Dept., Dt. 2-9-985]

            This rule does not admit of a major work being split up into parts and each part being
            given out on contract without calling for tenders.

            Exception :—This rule shall not apply to road works in the Agency tracts. In the case of
            such works, Executive Engineers are authorised to exercise their discretion as to
            whether tenders should be called for or not, even though the amount involved may exceed
            the limit of Rs. 2,500/-. In cases where the Executive Engineer decides not to call for
            tenders, the reasons for the decision should be recorded by him.

            Note 2 :— Notices calling for tenders should invariably be published in prominent local
            newspapers in respect of all works costing over Rs. 1,00,000/-.

            Note 3 :— The Chief Engineers may authorize dispensing with tenders in the case of
            contracts pertaining to major works provided that the total aggregate value of such
            contracts in respect of a particular major work does not exceed Rs.10,000.

            Note 4 :— When once tenders have been called for a work in accordance with Note (1)
            above and there is no response or all the tenders received are unsatisfactory and have
            to be rejected and it is considered that a call for further tenders will be fruitless or
            undesirable, the officer who is competent to accept the tender may allot the work to a
            contractor selected by him with the sanction of his immediate superior authority, at
            rates not exceeding estimate rates.

            Note 5 :— The rule in Note (1) above applies—

            (a) to contracts for execution of works including supply of materials for such works by
            the contractors themselves, but not to contracts involving only supply of materials
            (other than road quarry materials) or tools and plant; and

            (b) to contracts for the supply of road quarry materials.

            In the case of supply of materials (other than road quarry materials) and tools and
            plant, the stores rules in Appendix 15 to the Andhra Pradesh Financial Code (Volume II)
            apply — vide also Article 187 of the Andhra Pradesh Financial Code, Volume I. Asphalt,
            tar and such bituminous products for road surfacing are governed by the Stores rules.

            [Note 6 :— When once tenders have been called for a work in accordance with Note (1)
            above, ‘supplemental’ or ‘additional’ items may be entrusted to the original contractor
            dispensing with tenders as follows subject to the provisions of Para 176(e) of APPW ‘D’
            Code.

            1. Such items of work that are found necessary after letting out a contract and cannot
            be taken up for execution independently without interfering with the original work let
            out and have necessity to be executed along with the original contract shall be
            considered as ‘Supplemental items of work contingent of the original contract’.

            2. Supplemental items of work contingent on the main contract have to be necessarily
            carried out through the original contractor as ‘authorised extra’ by entertaining into a
            supplemental agreement(s). The power for executing original contracts according to
            delegation of powers in force regarding of who has executed the main contract in a given
            case, subject to however, to the condition that if the net effect of supplemental
            agreements to be entered into is to enhance the total value of work under the main and
            supplemental agreement to such an extent at sanction to revised estimate is required to
            a higher authority than sanction of the revised estimate from the higher authority shall
            be obtained before entering into supplemental agreement(s).

            3. Such items of works that are found necessary after letting out a work and be executed
            independently without affecting or interfering with the execution of the work let out,
            shall be considered as ‘Additional items to work not contingent on the original
            contracts’. Such additional items of work may be let out after call of tenders. However,
            if at tender call is considered undesirable and it is considered necessary to entrust
            the item of work on nomination to the original contractor involving the provision in
            Note (1) above it may be done so, provided the total value of such additional items does
            not exceed upto which the officers can entrust works without calling for tenders as per
            the delegation of powers in force. If the value of the items exceeds the limit, approval
            of the next higher authority shall be obtained. They can be executed only after separate
            estimate or a revised estimate or a workslip containing the additional items is
            sanctioned/approved by the competent authority. Entrustment of such items shall be at
            rate not exceeding the estimate rate.] [Subs. by G.O.Ms.No. 169, TR, R and B(Cl) Dept.,

            Note 7 :— (a) In the case of river conservancy works, reach—wise major estimates can be
            split up into the various working estimates, for different items of work, such as supply
            of stones, conveyance of stone by Punts along the River Channels or Canals and other
            miscellaneous works of pitching or packing stone or Earth work etc., where all these
            items of work cannot be successfully and speedily executed by one single contracting
            agency in time.

            (b) In the case of collection of stone which has to be made at short notice, the
            agencies for supply of stone and its conveyance can be fixed in advance by calling for
            open tenders for rate contract quotations annually for the period from July to end of
            June each year on the analogy of the rate contracts awarded by Director-General of
            Supplies and Disposals, for supply of stone materials and Tools and Plant articles.

            (c) [For the other miscellaneous items of works and those involving labour and earth
            work etc., reach-wise tenders may be called for. These tenders are to be compared with
            the basic rates and decided. The basic rates are arrived at by taking the average of the
            accepted tenders of the past three years]. [Subs. by G.O.Ms.No. 1169, P.W. (Code), Dt.

            (Memo.No. 101/Y/70—1, Dt. 20—7—1970)

            Order :—The Accountant General, Andhra Pradesh suggested to Government that in the case
            of works let out on nomination basis, an amount equal to 2 ½ or 5 per cent of the value
            of contract works has to be recovered from the contractors before the agreements in
            piece work or lumpsum forms respectively, are signed by competent authorities, as the
            provisions of parts 154 and 155 of the A.P.P.W.D. Code do not provide for the same. He
            desired that necessary clarification be made and the relevant rules in the P.W.D. Code
            be amplified.

            2. In consultation with Chief Engineer (General) and Accountant General, Andhra Pradesh,
            the Government of Andhra Pradesh direct that

            (i) The Earnest Money Deposit should be collected in respect of nomination contract as
            in the case of K—2 contracts but, where this is not done, i.e., where 2 ½ % is not
            collected in advance, deductions must be made from each bill at 5%, and

            (ii) These orders do not apply to job works for Rs. 500 and less and for works entrusted
            to special agencies of execution of like Bharat Sevak Samaj Labour Contract Cooperative
            Societies etc. _______

            Instruction

            (C.E.I’s. Cir. Memo.No.Rc.F1 (2)177279/68, Dt. 24—7—1970)

            Order :—Certain instances have come to the notice of the Government wherein officers of
            Public Works Department have awarded works on nomination by splitting up works when
            there was no response or poor response to tender calls for the entire work without again
            calling for tenders for the split up work.

            The attention of the Chief Engineer is invited to the instructions issued in Government
            Memo.No. 553—N2/66—2, P.W.D., dated 17—3—1966 and Government Memo.No. 94—Y/ 66—4, P.W.D.
            dated 16—1—1967. The Departmental Officers were authorised to split up large works in
            such a manner that they are capable of independent execution without interference with
            the progress and actual execution of the other places into which the work might have
            been split up. The intention is that the small contractors with limited resources may
            also have the opportunity to compete with the bigger contractors and reduce monopolistic
            tendencies. In spite of instructions in Para 2 of the Government Memo No. 94/Y/66—4,
            P.W.D., dated 16—1—1967, the Departmental Officers ha1l continue to invite tenders for
            large works though they can be conveniently split up into parts as envisaged in the
            above instructions. After noticing that there is poor response or no response from the
            tenders, the officers split up the work and entrust them on nomination. This practice
            deprives the benefit of lower rates to the Government, had tenders been called for again
            after splitting up the works.

            After careful consideration, the Government direct that the instruction issued in
            Government Memo. No. 94—Y—66—4, PWD, Dt. 16—1—1967 should be followed scrupulously. If,
            for any reason, it is not possible or convenient to slip up large works before calling
            for tenders and tenders are called for the entire work and there was no response poor
            response, the Departmental Officers should split up the works in a judicious manner and
            call for tenders again for these split up works. If the tenders are still high even
            after repeated tenders calls and if it is considered that further calls will be
            fruitless, the Departmental officer may allot the split up works on nomination to
            various contractors selected by him within the estimate rates as per Notes 1 and 4 of
            Para 154 of A.P.W. ‘D’ Code, or execute such works departmentally or through petty job
            works, supplying materials departmentally.

            The Chief Engineers under the administrative control of public Works Department and
            Public Works Department (Project Wing) are requested to ensure that the above
            instructions are scrupulously followed by all the officers concerned.

            Instruction

            (Memo.No. 759/Jrr. IV/2/75 8, Irrigation and Power Dept., Dt. 10-7-1975)

            Order :—In the Chief Engineer, Major Irrigation and General’s Circular Memo. first read
            above, the officers of the Department were instructed not to accept any tenders
            containing a rate more than about 15% above the sanctioned estimate rate for any
            individual item of work. The Superintending Engineers of Dowleshwaram and Anantapur
            circles have requested that the margin of 15% specified for each item in the Chief
            Engineer, Major Irrigation and General, Circular Memo may be raised to 25% as the
            tendered
            rates for individual items of work are likely to exceed the sanctioned estimate rate by
            more than 15% due to several indefinite factors. The Chief Engineer, Roads and Buildings
            had also suggested a variation of 25% instead of 15 per cent stating that some times the
            schedule of rates may not be realistic and further proposed that this 25 per cent
            variation from the estimate rate must apply both for excess rate as well as low rate
            quoted by the tenderer.

            The Board of Chief Engineers have considered the above proposals of the Superintending
            Engineer, Dowlaishwaram and Anantapur circle and the Chief Engineer, R and B, in their
            meeting held on 4—12—69 at Hyderabad and decided as follows

            1. To accept any tender containing a variation in rates of (plus) or (minus) 25% of the
            sanctioned estimate rate for any individual items of work.

            2. In respect of items of any tender where the variation in rates exceeds (plus) or
            (minus) 25% the specific approval of the next higher authority should be obtained.

            The Chief Engineer, Major Irrigation and General accordingly direct that the Officers of
            the P.W.D. Irrigation branch shall implement the above decisions of the Board of Chief
            Engineers with immediate effect in lieu of the instructions is issued in Chief Engineer.
            Major Irrigation General’s Circular Merno.No.Rc.F1(2)/77279/68, dated 3-10-1968.

            Deviation from the above instructions will be viewed seriously and the officer accepting
            the tender will personally be responsible for any monetary loss to Government.

            Instruction

            (Memo.No. 1348/Y/68 4, Dt. 24-11-1970)

            Order :—The Chief Engineer, Major Irrigation and General is informed that no approval of
            Government is required for tenders which are within the competency of Chief Engineer
            even if individual rates are over + 25%. It is for the Chief Engineer to examine the
            tenders in all aspects as per the rates in force, and accept the tender. Acceptance of
            tenders with individual rates over 25% is the responsibility of the Chief Engineer, and
            he should record reasons in the comparative statements, in case such tenders are
            accepted by him.

            Instruction

            During scrutiny of tenders and revised estimates various irregularities committed by
            Departmental officers in acceptance of tenders, and preparation of estimates have come
            to the notice of Government. It is observed that the irregularities committed were
            mainly due to nonobservance of the codal rules and instructions issued by the Government
            from time to time. The various irregularities noticed could be avoided if the
            departmental officers observed the codal rules scrupulously.

            The various types of irregularities noticed and remedial measures to be adopted to avoid
            a recurrence of such irregularities are detailed below for the guidance of the
            Departmental Officers.

            I. ACCEPTANCE OF TENDERS - MAJOR IRREGULARITIES - REMEDIAL MEASURES

            (1) Comparison of tenders with unapproved rates and in modified estimates

            In most of the cases the tenders are called for based on sanctioned estimates. But after
            receiving the tenders, the rates in the sanctioned estimates are stated to be unworkable
            and the tenders are compared with modified higher rates based on some data on the plea
            that the modified higher rates are workable ones.

            This procedure is not contemplated in the code rules. This irregularity must be avoided
            and tenders invariably compared and accepted with reference to the rates in the
            sanctioned estimates only. If the rates in the sanctioned estimates are found not
            workable with reference to the current S.S.R. due to the lapse of time or wrong data
            etc., the proper course would be either to submit revised estimate adopting current
            schedule of rates before the tender call is made for approval of the competent authority
            or to submit the tender along with the date to the Government justifying higher rates.

            (2) Acceptance of tenders above the estimate rates when competition is low

            There are cases where tenders have been accepted nearly at 5% above the estimate rates
            when the competition is low and even only one tender is received.

            The powers of accepting tenders upto the permissible limits above the rates in the
            sanctioned estimates should be used cautiously and only after making sure that the
            acceptance of such tenders is unavoidable.

            In case where there is no response to a tender call and a further call is considered
            fruitless, and the works are proposed to be entrusted on nomination, the works should be
            entrusted at or below estimate rates, and where the rates exceed the estimate rates as a
            result of negotiations with a selected contractor or contractors the sanction of the
            Government is necessary as per Government Memo No. 4l9/Y/66—3, dated 20—7—1966 and
            Govt.Memo.No. 1 856/Y/69—2, Dt. 29—12— 1969.

            Alternatively the instructions issued in Government Memo. No. 5531N/66—2, PWD, Dt.l7—
            3—1966 Government Memo. No. 94/Y/66—4, PWD, Dt. 16—1—1967 and Govt. Memo.No. 101/Y/70—l,
            PWD, Dt. 25—2—1970 for splitting up works in a judicious way and calling for tenders
            again for the split up works should be followed.

            (3) Lack of sufficient competition from tenders can be avoided if the following
            precautions are taken :

            (a) A minimum of one month’s time for the receipt of tenders should be given in tender
            notices, in respect of each tender for works above Rs.l lakh as per Para 154 of APWD
            Code.

            (b) Wide publicity should be given as contemplated in Note 2 under Para 154 of APWD
            Code.

            (c) Only one schedule of rates should be adopted by all Departments, that is PWD,
            Electricity, (R and B) etc., to avoid the dearth of contractors, where the rates are low
            Instructions issued in G.O.Ms.No. 781, PWD, dated 6—5—1967 should be followed.

            (d) If the tenders are still high even after repeated tender calls, departmental
            execution shall be tried by entrusting works to job workers within the estimate rates
            supplying materials departmentally, — Govt. Memo.No. 101/Y/70—I, PWD, Dt. 25—2—1970.

            (4) The authority accepting tenders should carefully observe the following points:

            (1) The high rates against any item should not be accepted unless they are justified
            with reliable data.

            (2) The monopoly of works by one or a few contractors in a circle or project should not
            be encouraged.

            (3) When tenders with high rates are submitted by all the contractors in league, they
            should be rejected, and departmental execution should be proposed.

            (5) calling for tenders and execution of works before administrative and technical
            sanctions are accorded

            Instances have come to the notice of Government wherein the Departmental officers have
            called for tenders for works and accepted them even before the administrative approval
            and technical sanction are accorded. This practice is contrary to the instructions in
            Para 173 of APWD Code. However, in respect of really emergent cases instructions in Para
            177 should be scrupulously followed.

            Instances have also come to the notice of Government wherein the departmental officers
            have accorded revised technical sanction even before the approval to the revised
            administrative estimate by the Government and called for tenders, which were compared
            with the revised estimate prepared. The instructions in Para I of the Government Memo.
            No. 3A/TC/66—I, PW (PW), dated 2 1—1—1967 that the revised estimates prepared by
            departmental officers should not be adopted by them for comparision and acceptance of
            tenders unless such revised estimates are approved by the Government should be followed.

            REVISED ESTIMATES - MAJOR IRREGULARITIES - REMEDIAL MEASURES

            1. Inadequate investigations :—Most of the schemes are not thoroughly investigated in
            respect of the site conditions and the estimates are prepared in a slipshad manner where
            by important items of works which should have been included in the estimates are
            omitted.

            A careful study of site conditions during the detailed survey will give proper
            assessment of the situation in order to make adequate provisions to suit the conditions.
            Thorough hydrological studies in respect of irrigation schemes are most essential to
            assess correctly the potentialities of the scheme before taking up the surveys, in order
            to avoid changes at a later stage modem geophysical instruments may be used to ascertain
            quickly the rock levels during the preliminary survey and the same may be verified by
            duly conducting clay drill core borings during the detailed survey in order to ensure
            the availability of sound rocknat an economical depth and to avoid the change of the
            scope of the scheme or the site at a later stage on account of the non—availability of
            sound rock for foundations. The block levelling and preparation of block plans will be
            helpful to finalise the alignment of branch canals and major distributaries and to
            localise the available commandable ayacut and to avoid alterations at any stage. In
            respect of the main canals and branches, and major and minor distributaries detailed
            survey to the last block (of 100 acres limit) is necessary to provide fairly correct
            assessment of the provisions, regarding (i) L.A., (ii) Head Sluices, (iii) Drops, (iv)
            CD. works, (v) Bridges etc., and of their correct positions in order to avoid any excess
            at a later stage. In addition, the evaluation of site conditions during the detailed
            investigations is very necessary, in order to have an idea of the availability of local
            materials and skilled labour and to assess the necessity for the importation of
            additional labour required for the works and to work out the probable cost towards their
            transportation charges and their amenities. Detailed investigation will help in real
            savings of money and time ultimately.

            Detailed estimates should be prepared before according administrative sanction in
            accordance with the instructions issued in Government Memo No. I 762/N2168—2, dated 25—
            5—1968.

            The Chief Engineers should personally inspect the site of projects costing over Rs. 10
            lakhs before according technical sanction according to the instructions issued in
            G.O.Ms.No. 1467, P.W.D., dated 16—5—1959 (Govt. Memo.No. 258/6071P.W.D., dated
            12—2—1969)

            2. Improper estimating:—Mistakes are noticed in working out the quantities and rates of
            items of work. Some times important items of works also are omitted while pertaining the
            estimates, due to lack of knowledge and experience and due to carelessness. Inspection
            of site and scrutiny of data by Superintending Engineers similarly as in the case of
            works costing over Rs. 10 lakhs which are reported to be inspected by Chief Engineers
            will help correct preparation of workable estimates with adequate and reasonable rates.
            Correct provision for all the items necessary for the work and correct preparation of
            data for a work is possible only if the officer has an intimate knowledge of how exactly
            the work is to be executed. Failure in this regard results in preparation of defective
            estimates leading to upward revision later.

            Excesses in revised estimates are not due to the increases in the cost of materials and
            labour rates but also due to the following facts.

            3. Changes in specifications:—In some estimates, etc., surki mortar originally proposed
            in the sanctioned estimate is changed to cement mortar during execution, due to the
            non-availability of good surki in the locality thus resulting in excess expenditure.

            It is necessary to study carefully the site conditions and the availability of local
            materials and to adopt suitable specifications to avoid changes at a large stage.
            Departmental officers should not change the specifications during execution without the
            prior approval of the authority who has sanctioned the technical estimate and also the
            authority competent to sanction the revised estimate if the extra expenditure involved
            necessitates preparation of a revised estimate. The change in the specification should
            not be proposed unless it is economical or unavoidable.

            4. Change in quarries and leads of materials :—Sometimes the excess in the estimate is
            reported to be due to increase in leads of materials on account of the quarries
            originally adopted not yielding the required quantity of materials.

            Necessity for change in quarries arises only if the quarries are not investigated
            properly in the first instance and the quarries adopted in the original estimate are not
            live ones, so it is necessary to study the site conditions carefully and propose good
            and live quarries which yield adequate materials.

            Suitable for the work so as to avoid change of quarries with increase leads for
            materials and consequent increased rates instructions issued in Government Memo. No. 161
            1—Y/67—19; dated 18—3—1969 for maintenance of a road Metal Rate Book should be followed
            scrupulously. Failure of officers to attend to this important item should be seriously
            viewed.

            According to condition 8 of the tender notice (IS contract) every tenderer is expected
            before quoting his rates to inspect the site of the proposed work and also the quarries
            and satisfy himself about the quality and availability of materials and the Government
            will not, after acceptance of a contract rate pay any extra charges for lead or any
            other reason, in case the contractor is found later on to have misjudged the material
            available. Inspite of the above specific provision it is noticed that the departmental
            officers are entering into supplemental agreements to cover extra leads on some protest
            or other, necessitating revision of estimates. This procedure is highly irregular and
            should not be adopted. Serious view should be taken if the above instructions are not
            followed scrupulously.

            5. Change in design, alignment and scope of the scheme :—It is noticed that the designs
            originally prepared are often revised, alignment of canals and branches are changed and
            the scope of the scheme are also changed adopting alternative sites for the construction
            of main structures during the execution without obtaining the prior approval of the
            authority competent to accord administrative sanction. For example, cause ways designed
            in the original estimate are changed as submergeable bridges during execution involving
            excess cost. The alignment originally proposed is changed, adopting alternative
            alignment which is not economical. The original site proposed for the construction of
            spillway and earth dam is changed during execution adopting an alternative site and
            thereby changing the scope of the scheme.

            As required in Para 189 of APWD Code the departmental officers should not change the
            design or alignment of canal or change the dam site during execution without prior
            approval of the authority who sanctioned the original scheme. These changes should not
            by proposed unless they are economical or unavoidable.

            6. Inclusion of new items not originally contemplated :—The L.S. provisions like cross
            masonry works, namely drainage culverts, syphons, aqueducts and bridges originally
            provided are found subsequently inadequate during execution and thus the new works
            originally not contemplated are proposed and executed with huge excess.

            It is necessary to take up the detailed investigation of canal branches and
            distributaries and to assess correctly the number of structures required and their
            positions for estimating their cost after preparing detailed estimates wherever possible
            for each type work and providing adequate S.S. provisions for similar works on the basis
            of past experience instead of providing inadequate L.S. provisions, in order to avoid
            the omission of essential masonry works. It is also noticed that detailed estimates are
            not worked out for all masonry works of canals and distributaries while obtaining
            original sanction and while according technical Sanction by Departmental Officers and
            even while approaching Government revised administrative sanction. The L.S. provisions
            are generally allowed during preliminary survey but not in the original estimates
            submitted for sanction after detailed investigations. It is necessary that detailed
            estimates are worked out for all works including canals and distributaries during the
            detailed investigations. It requires careful study and past experience to make the
            provisions under L.S. items as accurately as possible. So a careful scrutiny of
            proposals by superior officer is necessary in the preparation of proper estimates with
            realistic provisions.

            7. Importation of labour and providing labour amenities —Evaluation of site conditions
            is generally not done during the detailed investigation to ensure adequate provision in
            the original estimate. On account of this the departmental officers are not posted with
            the resources available in the area with reference to the availability of skilled and
            unskilled labour and additional imported labour necessary to execute the works.

            It is necessary to assess the quantum of additional imported labour necessary for items
            of works with reference to quantities and the labour required (as per Standard Data)
            according to the phased programme to complete the execution and the cost involved in the
            transportation of labour from a particular place and to work out the cost for
            importation of additional labour necessary. Depending on the number of additional labour
            necessary importation, the cost towards labour amenities should be worked out. The
            departmental officers should carefully study the site conditions during investigation
            and make adequate provision in the original estimates for the importation of labour and
            labour amenities after working out the cost for all works when the distances and other
            conditions are not identical. So it is necessary to work out realistic estimates to
            minimise excess in the estimates to a reasonable extent. The instructions issued in
            G.O.Ms.No. 1624, P.W.D., dated 29-1 1-1969 and G.O.Ms.No.1452, P.W. (Y) Dept., dated
            29-8-1970 regarding the procedure to be adopted in making provision for importation of
            labour and labour amenities in the estimates should be followed scrupulously.

            8. Anticipated credits :—It is noticed that suitable provisions is not being made in the
            estimates towards anticipated credits, if any, e.g., dismantled materials stone obtained
            in (excavation) which is useful value of retrievable materials. Suitable provision
            should be made towards anticipated credits in the estimates invariably in future.

            9. Changes in classification of soils:—Many estimates are being revised due to higher
            classification of soils met with during actual execution. It shows that detailed
            estimates are not prepared carefully, by excavating adequate number of trial pits to the
            required bed levels of canals and classifying the soil correctly. The detailed estimates
            should always be prepared after excavating trial pits to the proposed bed level and the
            trial pits should be spaced at a minimum of 110” intervals so as to give reasonably
            accurate picture of classification of soils. Before starting the excavation of the main
            canals of big size (or when higher classification is expected during the excavation)
            pre-classification of soils as per trial trench classification at 1 10” intervals is
            recommended. In fact the trial trench classification (Pre-classification of soils) is a
            fool-proof method, which may make it impossible for the contractors to claim higher
            classification of works after completing the excavation of works. On the other hand, the
            open classification of soils based on thandogs left after excavation is completed would
            give room for corrupt practices by reclassification of soils to the higher side.
            Moreover, it is also possible to know the variation in the classification of soils
            between the estimate and actual execution before starting the excavation of canals, by
            adopting trial trench classification of soils to assess the excess cost for obtaining
            revised administrative approval. The trial trench classification has been adopted in the
            execution of N.S. Main Canals excavation with good results, thus considerably minimising
            the excess due to variation in the classification of soils. As reported by Chief
            Engineers, N.S. Canals variations of the classification of soils are not much upto 42/0
            mile of N.S. Right Canals where trial trench classification was adopted for the works
            executed through contractors except in the reach 35/4+330 to 360 miles where open
            classification was adopted for the works executed through workers. It is useful to adopt
            the same procedure in all schemes in the state for the excavation of canals with wide
            sections or wherever more than three classifications of soils are anticipated, in order
            to avoid excess due to classification of less soils.

            10. According technical sanction to the estimates beyond 10 per cent against the
            corresponding sub-head provision of the sanctioned project estimate :—Instructions were
            issued in Para 4 of the G.O.Ms.No. 800, P.W. and T., Dt. 21-4-1955, that without
            sanction of competent authority, expenditure in excess of the provision in the sub-heads
            of the sanctioned estimates should not be incurred. Again in Government Memo. No. 553
            1N2/ 66-2, P.W.D., dated 17-3-1966 instructions were issued that wherever excess
            expenditure is anticipated in any subhead, sanction of Government should be obtained for
            the excess in the sub-head.

            Also Chief Engineers have been instructed to ensure that whenever the sub-head provision
            exceeds 10% of the corresponding provision of the sanctioned project estimate they
            should approach the Government for approval and no estimate should be technically
            sanctioned by them or other officers beyond permissible limit pending Government
            sanction except when it is ensured that the excess can be met from the probable savings
            under other sub-heads.

            In spite of the above instructions, it is observed that, in many instances, the
            departmental officers are according technical sanctions in respect of sub-works much in
            excess of the provisions in project estimates against the sub-heads and also beyond
            their powers to sanction excesses without obtaining prior sanction of the Government.
            Monthly statements in respect of works costing Rs. 5 lakhs and above showing upto date
            total amount of estimates sanctioned technically against the corresponding sub-head
            provisions of the sanctioned project estimates are being furnished to Government. In
            order to keep a watch on the estimates sanctioned by departmental officers and to see
            that it does not exceed the sanctioned sub-head provisions of the project estimate for
            which administrative approval is accorded, similar action may be taken in respect of
            works costing below Rs.5 lakhs. If sufficient care is taken in this regard, excess in
            R.E. will, be fully kept under check.

            11. Submission of revised estimates based on actuals :—The departmental officers have
            powers to accept tenders and execute works with excess quantities only upto the limits
            specified. If excesses are beyond their competition to approve, the revised estimates
            have to be sanctioned by Government. Abuse of powers by departmental officers in
            incurring expenditure beyond the limits specified should be taken serious notice of.

            12. Incorrect comparision of revised estimate, with the estimates sanctioned technically
            for the purpose of obtaining revised administrative sanction :—It is observed that,
            while submitting the revised estimates to Government for obtaining revised
            administrative sanction the provisions in the revised estimate are being compared with
            the provisions in the estimate sanctioned technically by departmental officers (which
            are generally in excess of about 10% over the amount of administrative sanction).

            The Chief Engineers are informed that the Accountant-General has suggested that the
            revised estimates may be compared with original administration approval as well as
            technical sanction. The Chief Engineers are requested to follow the above procedure.

            13. Submission of a revised estimates after the work is completed :—Revised estimates
            with huge excesses are sent to Government for approval long after the works are
            completed. Thus the departmental officers are transferring their powers and confronting
            the Government with an accomplished fact with the confidence that by such method their
            actions will automatically be ratified by Government.

            The Departmental Officers have been told repeatedly that as soon as the excess in the
            estimate is found necessary or unavoidable, they should submit a revised estimate at an
            early stage of construction. The Departmental officers should scrupulously follow
            instructions in Para 214 of A.P.P.W.D. Code and avoid incurring excess expenditure
            beyond their powers without prior approval of the competent authority. Un-authorised
            execution of works in excess of sanctioned amount beyond the permissible limits will be
            viewed seriously by the Government.

            14. Deliberate under-estimating :—Cases of deliberate underestimating so as to ensure
            that the scheme is sanctioned giving revenue return of 1.5% for M.I. schemes for
            reducing the estimate cost to enable its being sanctioned at the level of Chief Engineer
            or Superintending Engineers have come to the notice of Government.

            The departmental officers must give a correct picture of the actual cost of the scheme
            leaving the discretion to Government for its sanction. Under estimating or intentionally
            reducing the cost of scheme should be avoided.

            15. Delays in execution result in excess cost :—Due to delay in the execution of the
            scheme as per the phased programme, the cost of the schemes will shoot up because of the
            price spiral.

            Speedy execution and completion of works before the target dates will reduce the cost of
            construction and avoid revision of estimate. Estimates should be prepared making
            necessary and adequate provisions to complete the works under phased programme, after
            careful study of the resources and the site conditions. The real efficiency of the
            departmental officers has to be judged with reference to the preparation realistic
            estimates and execution of works within the target dates with economy and without
            boosting up the rates. Speedy execution of works with exorbitant rates should not be
            allowed except in the case of emergent works, and that too with the approval of the
            competent authority.

            16. Procedure for dealing with inevitable excesses that may occur during execution of
            works :—The excess in the revised estimates of major projects and schemes may be
            inevitable due to conditions beyond the control of the department example

            1. Increase in cost in the present context of rising cost of works that are spread over
            a long period.

            2. Increase in schedule of rates on labour and materials.

            3. Increase in the cost of controlled materials.

            4. Increase due to more excavation foundations based on the geology of rocks.

            5. Increase in un-precedented and providential damages if reported in advance and the
            cost of such damages and proposed write off as per clause 50 of A.P.S.S.

            The officers should deal such cases judiciously and intimate the competent authority in
            advance. [CE’s Circular Memo.No. Rc A2/77279/68, Dt. 16-2-1978]

            (1) The Board of Chief Engineers at its meeting held on 4-12-1969 have decided that in
            respect of items of any tender where the variation in rates exceeding (plus) or (minus)
            25 per cent the specific approval of the next higher authority should be obtained. The
            Chief Engineer (Projects) Drainage wing has pointed out during discussions in the Board
            of Chief Engineers meeting held on 30-1-1971 that several minor items in a tender
            involving variation in quoted rate over and above (plus) or (minus) 25% are being
            referred to higher authorities for approval even though such minor items have no
            material effect on the overall tender percentage excess or less as they are all of very
            small value. He has therefore suggested that;

            (2) The approval may have to be obtained from higher authority for items exceeding
            (plus) or (minus) 25 per cent over estimates rate provided the tendered value of such
            item is above Rs. 1,000/— on any individual items or alternatively the estimated value
            of such items put together is lower 10 per cent of the estimate value of tender under
            consideration.

            (3) The above suggestion was considered by the Chief Engineers at the meeting held on
            30-11971 and it was decided to clarify the previous decision of the Board of Chief
            Engineers, dated 412-1969 mentioned in Para 1 above as follows.

            (4) In respect of items of any tender where the variation in rates exceeds (plus) or
            (minus) 25 per cent the specific approval of the next higher authority should be
            obtained.

            (5) However, in respect of minor items in a tender, whose quoted rate will not
            substantially affect the overall tender percentage, the authority competent to accept
            the tender can do so without referring to higher authority irrespective of the
            percentage variation in the quoted rate after full satisfying himself that the quantity
            specified in the tender schedule under these minor items do not alter in actual
            execution.

            (6) The S.Es. are informed, that for any variation in the quantities specified in the
            tender schedule under such minor items with abnormal high or less rates during actual
            execution resulting in charge is the over-all tender percentage of the tender, the
            tender accepting authority who has accepted these rates under the above discretionary
            powers will be held personally responsible for any consequent monetary loss to
            Government. (Govt.Merno.No. I 6—Y/72—4, Dt. 13-3-1972)

            A review of the quarterly return on the acceptance of tenders other than the lowest has
            revealed some irregularities in the acceptance of tenders. The following instructions
            are issued for the guidance of departmental officers:

            Acceptance of the lowest tender:—In respect of the work relating to strengthening of
            Surepally Major Distributary, the lowest tender was rejected on the ground that the
            tenderer did not sign the tender documents. Non signing of a specification should not be
            the sole reason for rejection of the tender. If the tender is otherwise acceptable, the
            tender accepting authority should call for the tender and obtain his signature. The
            Chief Engineer (Major Irrigation and General) is requested to re-circulate the Chief
            Engineer’s Confidential Officers for their guidance. In respect of the same work, the
            second lowest tender also was rejected on the ground that it had been received late
            after the time fixed for receipt of tenders. Tenders received after the time should not
            be taken into consideration for comparison of tenders. Such lapses should be avoided.

            In respect of work relating to excavation of the toe trench in block No. 73 of Srisailam
            Dam, the lowest tender was rejected on the ground that the tenderer was a new man.
            According to the confidential instructions issued by the Chief Engineer (General) in
            Memo.No.1237-Ac/G1., dated 19-6-1935 the fact that the lowest tenderer is a new man is
            not by itself a sufficient reason for the rejection of his tender. In such cases,
            enquiries should be made as to his financial status and capability. If having regard to
            the nature of the work to be done and the result of enquiries it is found that the
            tenderer is suitable, his tender should be rejected. Instructions in the Chief
            Engineer’s Memo.No.1237/Act/35/G1, dated 19-6-1935 should be scrupulously followed by
            the Departmental Officers.

            Finalisation of tenders within the validity period:- It is noticed that tenders which
            require Government approval are sent up to Government after considerable delay. In all
            cases where approval of higher authority is required, the Chief Engineer should ensure
            that tenders are sent to the concerned authority as quickly as possible at any rate
            within one month of their receipt.

            The monthly return presented in Government Memo.No.1406-Y/70-1, dated 25-1-1970 should
            indicate where the delay occurred as also the detailed reasons for the delay.

            Revision of tenders after tender call:- In some cases it has been noticed that after
            call of tenders revision of estimates has been proposed. Revision of estimates after
            tender call with a view to bringing down tender percentage is irregular. If there is
            need for revision of estimates, it should be done before the tenders are called for.

            In the return of the Chief Engineer, Nagarjunasagar Left Canals for the quarter ending
            March, 1971 some items were not shown although acceptance of tenders was over for the
            reason that the arrangements were not concluded. It is clarified that the date of
            acceptance of the tender is the criterian for inclusion in the quarterly return and not
            the date of conclusion of agreement.

            Note: Tenders should invariably be called for when the amount involved in a particular
            contact is Rs.20,000 or more. If it is proposed, in any case, whether for urgency or any
            other reason, to depart from this rule, and entrust the works on nomination at rates not
            exceeding estimate rates, the previous approval of the Superintending Engineer should be
            obtained in the case of works costing not more than Rs.50,000 of the Chief Engineer in
            the case of work costing not more than Rs.1,00,000. When the amount is less than
            Rs.20,000 the Executive Engineer may call for tenders at his discretion. This rule does
            not however, admit of a major work being split into parts each costing less than
            Rs.20,000 and each part being given on contract without calling for tenders. In the case
            of Chief Engineer Works, powers of the Executive Engineer, Superintending Engineer and
            Chief Engineer to dispense with the call of tenders are limited to Rs.1,000, Rs.2,500
            and Rs.5,000 respectively.

            Exception:- Deleted.

            Note 2:- Notices calling for tenders should invariably be punished in prominent news
            papers in respect of all works costing over Rs.5,00,000] [G.O.Ms.No.1007, T.R. and B.,
            Dt.5-11-1976]

            Instruction

            Execution of Works under contract system — Revision of Estimates, etc. — Modification of
            existing provisions

            (GO. Ms. No. 37, Transport, Roads and Buildings (B.I.) Dept. Dt. 30-1-1990)

            Order —Government have been considering for some time various measures aimed at
            promoting efficiency and economy as also time and cost consciousness in planning and
            implementation of various public projects. It is considered that inadequate and
            superficial investigation practices vastly contribute to diseconomies and inefficiencies
            and some times even to outright wastage of public resources. Faulty investigation not
            only leads to subsequent inflation of costs, but also inhibits competitive bids, which
            would have been otherwise forthcoming, if the entire quantities of work involved are
            correctly estimated and included in the original tender. Further change if the scope of
            the work midway leads to cost escalation, legal complications, unintended benefits to
            contractors and inordinate delays in the completion of projects. In order to effectively
            control the time and cost overruns in the implementation of the projects and to fix up
            specific responsibility for proper investigation, implementation and monitoring of the
            projects and to avoid additional burden on public exchequer by way of escalation and
            subsequent revision of estimates, the following instructions are issued :—

            (I) As all the project works are to be implemented strictly in a time bound manner, no
            clause providing for escalation shall be included in any future contract except in
            respect of works covered by external assistance.

            (2) As already laid down in G.O. Ms. No. 430, dated 24th October, 1983, all claims of
            the contractors above Rs. 50,000/- should be settled in a Court of competent
            jurisdiction by way of a regular suit and the agreement should specifically prohibit
            arbitration for settling such claims.

            (3) The A.P.P.W. Department Code already provides that the Chief Engineer should inspect
            all works costing over Rs. 10 lakhs before technical sanction is accorded. In order to
            ensure that this inspection serves the objective in view, a detailed check-memo is
            hereby prescribed and given in Annexure-I to this G.O. The Chief Engineer’s inspection
            should be thorough and detailed and should cover

            (a) the suitability of site

            (b) the suitability of foundations

            (c) adequacy of design

            (d) soils and materials (qualitative and quantitative) and leads

            (e) soil classification of trial pits upto hard rock level

            (I) De-watering

            (g) land acquisition

            (h) forest clearance, etc.

            Only after the Chief Engineer is thoroughly satisfied on all the above aspects that the
            project is feasible and is also capable of immediate execution and the estimate
            represents a true and correct picture of the work involved, he should accord the
            technical sanction.

            A check slip for the inspection of the Chief Engineer is given at Annexure. A copy of
            the technical sanction issued, together with the inspection report, should be invariably
            sent to the Government. If these instructions are followed, the cases of revision of
            estimates particularly on account of change in the soil classification or quantities of
            materials should be few and far between. It is expected that the Chief Engineer would
            personally satisfy himself that the estimate technically sanctioned by him incorporates
            the full requirements of the project consistent with the conditions at site.

            These instructions should also be followed mutatis mutandis by Superintending Engineers
            and Executive Engineers while according technical sanction with the modification that
            copies of the technical sanction and inspection report be submitted to the next higher
            authority.

            (4) Since most of the works are on L.S. contract system, time is the essence of a
            contract. It is therefore absolutely necessary that a realistic period for the execution
            of the work is assured at the beginning and strictly adhered to.

            For this purpose, at the time of entering into an agreement, the contractor should be
            asked to give a detailed programme for execution of work, physically and financially
            (item wise), completing the entire work well within the time prescribed. In the
            alternative, the consent of the contractor should be obtained to the programme work
            drawn up by the department. If the work is not completed at the end of the contract
            period, action should be taken to determine the contract under the relevant clause of
            A.P.D.D. S. If there are valid reasons for extending the contract period, proposals for
            extension of time should be sent to the authority competent to accord administrative
            sanction sufficiently in advance and in any case at least one month before the expiry of
            the contract period.

            It may be specifically provided that the period of agreement operates from the date of
            signing of agreement and not from the time of handing over of site, as some contractors
            deliberately avoid taking possession of the site.

            In respect of check measurements and passing of bills :—

            (5) Check measurement should be done as per para 294 of A.P.W.D. Code and G.O. Ms. No.
            405, Irrigation (Projects Wing) Department, dated 14-8-1984. The components selected for
            check measurement should not be less than 50% of the value of the work done and
            specially include such of the items where there is scope for fraud, In the case of
            embankments, L.S. of Cut-offs should invariably be checked for levels as well as for
            soil classification and also their suitability for foundation and impermeability by the
            sanctioning authority or by the Superintending Engineer incharge of the work. In
            cuttings, soil classification should be checked as per the existing instructions
            contained in Government Memorandum No. 364fNSP-II(i)180-21, dated 29-10-1984.

            Whenever the total value of work executed under contract exceeds the percentages of
            passing of excess by respective sanctioning authorities, further work is to be executed
            only after sanction of Government.

            (6) On-going works and extension of time —In respect of on-going works, for which
            technical sanction was accorded by Chief Engineers, in which the final expenditure is
            expected to exceed the original estimate by more than 15%, a report should be sent to
            the Government within one month from the date of issue of this order. The particulars of
            such works should be furnished clearly explaining the circumstances under which the
            provisions in the original estimate are being exceeded. Copies of the reports should be
            simultaneously sent to Commissionerate of Tenders, who shall scrutinise the proposals
            and offer their comments on the justification for exceeding the estimate provisions.
            After taking due note of the comments of the Commissionerate of Tenders, orders will be
            issued by the Government. Pending issue of such orders by the Government, expenditure
            could be incurred upto 15% over and above the amount for which administrative sanction
            has been accorded.

            2. All the Chief Engineers should ensure that cases in which estimates of works are to
            be revised, are inspected immediately by Superintending Engineers and Executive
            Engineers concerned and proposals are sent to Government and Commissionerate of Tenders
            within the time frame prescribed.

            3. To the extent of the instructions issued above, all earlier instructions and
            provisions of the code stand modified. Annexure

            unless accompanied by a treasury chalan for earnest money to the extent which has been
            notified as necessary in the tender notice. The earnest money is the guarantee of the

            intimation of the acceptance of his tender. It is forfeited in case of default — vide

            In selecting the tender to be accepted, the financial status of the tenderers, their
            capability, the security offered by them or the record of their execution of any works
            previously, should be taken into consideration. Other conditions being equal, the lowest
            tender should be accepted. In cases where a tender other than the lowest is accepted, a
            confidential record should be kept of the reasons for doing so. Specific data with
            reference to the financial solvency, income-tax paid, the ability of the contractor to
            execute the work, security offered by him, the names of at least some works executed
            formally by the contractor, amount involved therein and the conduct and performance of
            the contractor during the execution of work should be given. This information should be
            furnished not only in respect of the tenderer whose tender has been accepted but also of
            the tenderers whose tender has been rejected. The relative merits of the various
            contractors concerned should be discussed and cogent reasons should be given while
            rejecting lower tenders, if they are to be rejected. This confidential record should be
            shown to the Inspecting Officer of the Audit department, if required.

            In addition, in cases where it is proposed to accept a tender other than the lowest, the
            authority competent to accept the tender should, immediately after accepting it, make a
            report to indicating the reasons for accepting a higher tender to the next higher
            authority, who shall scrutinise the report carefully and call for more details if
            necessary. The Superintending Engineer or Executive Engineer as the case may be, should
            bring to the notices of the higher authorities cases in which the rule about the
            acceptance of the lowest tender has been departed from without sufficient justification.

            The acceptance or rejection of tenders is, however, left entirely to the discretion of
            the officer to whom the duty is entrusted and no tenderer can demand the cause of
            rejection of his offer.] (Subs. by G.O.Ms.No. 773, PWD, Dt. 5—6—1971)

            preamble clauses in the standard printed form of a L.S. contract or striking out
            irrelevant words in a K-2 contract, such as SDO/Executive Engineer or other minor
            corrections in descriptions or rates, the corrections should be initialled by both
            parties to the contract and each initial dated. Where additional items are incorporated
            in a contract, at a subsequent date they should be drawn up as a separate memorandum,
            and signed by both parties to the contract, and fixed as an annexure to a contract.
            There may be any number of Annexures to a contract but they should be serially numbered
            in a chronological order and an index of these entered in a blank page of the main
            contract under the initials of both the parties.

            the Governor of Andhra Pradesh, the different classes of deeds, contracts and other
            instruments are detailed in Appendix III. This power is, however, in each case subject

            Collection of EMD from contractors for works let out on nomination
            (1) Earnest Money Deposit should be collected even in respect of nomination contracts as
            in the case of K-2 contracts, but when this is not done, in cases where 2 ½ % is not
            collected in advance, deductions must be made from each bill at 5 per cent, and
            (2) These orders does not apply to job works for Rs.500 and less and for works entrusted
            to special agencies of execution like Bharat Sevak Samaj, Labour Contract
            Co-operatives etc.
            (G.O.Ms.No. 2215, PWD, Dt. 21-10-1965)
            As per Para 459 of APP WA Code the EMD can be refunded only after the final bill is
            paid. In G.O.Ms.No. 154, PWD, Dt. 23-6-1966, the Government have clarified that where
            the final bill is not paid within six months period of observation, the security deposit
            withheld from the final bill should be retained for the six months period of observation
            and refunded after the expiry of this period (not before this period) with the specific
            permission of the Chief Engineer).
            (G.O.Ms.No.1926, PWD, Dt. 2-8-1 965)
            (3) The S.E. is competent to execute contracts and piece work agreements upto the limit

            by C.E. or Government and irrespective of the restrictions imposed on the powers of S.E.

            work, even though the estimated cost of the work may exceed the amount up to which he is

            the amount of each contract is within the limit of the officer’s power to accept
            tenders, But no contract may be entered into with any individual contractor in excess of
            this limit nor may a second contract be entered into with a contractor, who has already
            received a contract in connection with the same work; which is still in force, if the
            sum of the contracts exceeds the power of acceptance of tenders of the authority

            The following rules must be carefully noted :—
            (1) No officer may enter into a contract into which he is not empowered to enter under
            the provisions of Paragraph 159 and Appendix III to this Code.

            (2) The limitations defined in a Paragraph 415(v), 416(iv), 422, 431 or 436(d) shall not
            be exceeded.

            (3) No authority may accept any contract for a work until an assurance has been received
            from the authority competent to provide funds for the same, that such funds will be
            allotted before the liability matures — vide the last sentence of Paragraph 173.

            (4) On no account should rates in excess of those provided in the agreement be paid, as
            the payment of such rates which are not due would nullify the contract.

            (5) Duplication of agreements should in no case be required, that is to say, an
            authority who has concluded an agreement should not be required to thaw up and sign
            again an agreement already executed — vide also Rule 2 under Paragraph 95, A.P. Public
            Works Accounts Code.

            (6) No authority subordinate to the Local Government may waive the provisions of the
            stores purchase rules in Appendix 15 to the A.P. Financial and Account Code (Volume II).

            When land which is not already in the possession of the Government is permanently
            required for the purposes of the Government it should be acquired through the agency of
            the Land Acquisition Act (Act I of 1894), which alone can confer an indefeasible title.
            The officer concerned should, in the first instance, consult the Revenue Divisional
            Officer and obtain from him the fullest possible information as to the probable cost of
            the land per acre or otherwise, together with the value of buildings etc., situated on
            the property, for which compensation will have to be paid, and a draft notification
            under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act. Upon the information thus obtained, an
            estimate should be framed by the Public Works Officer and submitted for sanction. The
            draft notification should be submitted with the estimate for the approval of Government
            and published in the Andhra Pradesh Gazette, In cases in which the owner of a land about
            to be acquired is willing to make a free gift of the land required, a deed of gift
            should not be executed in favour of Government, but the procedure prescribed by the Land
            Acquisition Act should be followed and an award should be passed under Section 11 of the
            Act for the full market value of the land and not for a nominal amount. The owner who is
            willing to make a free gift of the land should receive the compensation awarded and may
            make a gift of the amount of the compensation to Government to be utilized for the
            public purpose for which the land is acquired.
            There is, however, no objection to local officers negotiating with the owners of land
            with the object of coming to an amicable agreement with them as to the price to be paid
            previous to the intimation of the proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act, with a
            view to guard against subsequent exorbitant demands or awards, provided that this
            procedure will result in economy. Any settlement thus arrived at should immediately be
            communicated to the Land Acquisition Officer. The settlement must take the form of an
            agreement that the owner is willing to sell for a certain specific sum plus 15 per cent
            of that sum for compensation, the total of two sums being the actual price agreed on.

            In cases of urgency acquisition should be made under Section 17 of the Act; possession
            is then obtainable fifteen days after publication of notice under Section 9(1) of the
            Land Acquisition Act. When possession has once been taken under Section 16 or 17 of the
            Act, Government cannot withdraw from its acquisition, therefore, when the claim is in
            large excess of the award possession should not be taken without a reference to the
            authority sanctioning the work.

            When sanction to an estimate framed as above directed has been obtained and when the
            draft notification referred to in Paragraph 166 has been published, the Executive
            Engineer should make over the mailer to the Revenue Divisional Officer who will take the
            necessary steps for the acquisition and transfer of the land, subject to instructions
            which he may receive from Revenue authorities to whom he is subordinate. These
            instructions provide that if the estimate originally framed and sanctioned is likely,
            when the land comes to be acquired, to be materially exceeded, the Revenue Officer
            making the award should give sufficient notice to the Public Works Officer and should
            take into consideration any representation which such officers may make, whether it is
            made orally or by letter.

            More especially he would, before making the award, allow such officer an opportunity of
            appearing in person or by agent and producing evidence as to the value of the land. When
            such a reference is made, the Public Works Officer should, if it is found impossible to
            obtain the land required without materially exceeding the estimate, or to obtain some
            other plot of land in lieu of that originally proposed, submit a revised estimate for
            sanction. When possession has once been taken under Section 16 or 17 of the Act,
            Government cannot withdraw from the acquisition of the land. In cases, therefore, where
            the amount claimed in pursuance of a notice under the Act largely in excess of the
            amount subsequently awarded by the Collector, and the acquisition of the land is not
            absolutely necessary, possession should not be taken without a reference to the
            authority sanctioning the work until the time within which an application for a
            reference to the Court must be made under Section 18 of the Act has elapsed without such
            application being made.

            The arrangements between the officers of the department and the Revenue Officers to
            determine as to which land should be taken up should, where practicable, be made without
            divulging the intentions of the Government in order to prevent the prices being put up
            and to render private bargaining possible.

            After the preliminary arrangements described in the preceding Paragraphs have been duly

            Special Officer, placed at the disposal of the Public Works Department and invested with
            the powers of a Collector under the Act. The procedure in two cases is described in the

            No land, whether—
            (a) within cantonment limits,
            (b) forming part of an encamping ground, or
            (c) otherwise held for military purposes,
            should be taken up or occupied for any purposes whatever, either by contractors or any
            other persons (official or non-official) acting under the orders of any Civil Department
            of the State, until the sanction of the Government of India in the Defence Department to
            the occupation or use of the land has first been obtained and communicated to the
            General Officer Commanding the Division or Independent Brigade. In all such cases, the
            sanction of the Government of India should be obtained by the General Officer Commanding
            the Division or Independent Brigade through the Quarter-master-General in India.
            Application for such land when within cantonment limits should be made by the officer in
            charge of the works to the cantonment authority and by the latter to the superior
            military authority, but in the case of military encamping ground application should be
            made to the General Officer Commanding the Division or Independent Brigade. The Military
            authorities will then take the necessary steps to obtain (i) the opinion of the State
            Government, which should invariably be recorded upon all applications, and (ii) the
            sanction of the Government of India to the occupation of the required land. The
            foregoing procedure will apply in cases where it is proposed to purchase, or otherwise
            acquire permanently, any building situated on military land for the use of a Civil
            Department.

        </para_name>
        <para_desc>

            (i) Lands in charge of the Public Works Department are of two kinds—
            (1) Lands acquired by the Public Works Department for the construction of buildings but
            not immediately used for the purpose, and
            (2) Lands in charge of Public Works Department for administrative purposes, e.g., land
            in berms of canals, drains, channels, etc., and at wharfs.
            (ii) The procedure of grant under the Crown Grants Act should be adopted for grants of
            these lands for temporary occupation for agriculture and non-agriculture purposes.

            Grants for such occupation may be made in favour of individuals, private bodies,
            companies or associations and local bodies.
            (iii) The grants will be made in consultation with the Revenue Department where
            necessary. Rent should be collected departmentally in the case of grants.
            (iv) The period for which temporary occupation of the lands in charge of the Public
            Works Department may be sanctioned, must be determined carefully in each case with
            reference to the nature of the property and the consideration whether the property is
            likely to be required by Government for any other purpose.
            (v) The grant in each case, after sanction by competent authority, should be embodied in
            an order in the form given in Appendix XIII—B in the case of grants for agricultural
            purposes and in Appendix XIII—C in the case of grants for non-agricultural purposes,
            with suitable modifications, where necessary, by the Executive Engineer concerned, as
            the assigning authority and delivered to the party. The items enumerated below by way of
            illustration will be cases for such grants for non-agricultural purposes:—
            (a) Recreation purposes with or without a pavilion or club house.
            (b) Bridges and culverts, whether permanent or temporary.
            (c) Banks (for trade purposes).
            (d) Timber and firewood depots.
            (e) Laying pipe lines.
            (f) Unobjectionable sub-soil encroachments on road margins and other Government
            porambokes.
            (g) Temporary occupation of Government land for performances by a touring cinema, circus
            or dramatic company.
            The items enumerated below will be cases for grants for agricultural purposes:—
            (a) Growing or grass or other fodder.
            (b) Raising flower gardens.
            (c) Planning casuarina.
            (d) Cultivation of plantation products.
            (e) Cultivation of paddy, pulses and other food grains or commercial crops like tobacco,
            cashew, groundnuts, etc.
            (vi) These grants need not be registered — vide Section 90(1)(d) of the Indian
            Registration Act, The orders embodying such grants are also not liable to stamp duty —
            vide item 4 of Notification No. 13, dated the 17th December, 1938.
            (vii) The orders of Government must be obtained in every case of grant in which the
            value of the property exceeds Rs. 30,000. The Chief Engineer may sanction grants in all
            cases in which the value of the property exceeds Rs. 15,000 but does not exceed Rs.
            30,000 upto a period of five years. The Superintending Engineers may sanction grants in
            cases in which the value of property exceed Rs. 3,000 but does not exceed Rs. 15,000
            upto a period of five years, subject to any administrative instructions issued by the
            Chief Engineer. Similarly, the Executive Engineers may sanction grants in cases in which
            the value of the property is Rs. 3,000 or less upto a period of three years, subject to
            any administrative instructions issued by the Superintending Engineer or higher
            authority.
            (viii) In all these grants, the period of notice to be given under Condition 21 in
            Appendix XIII-B or Condition 19 in Appendix XIII—C by the assigning authority or by the
            grantee should be fixed carefully with reference to all the relevant circumstances and
            specified in the order. This period should not exceed the period of grant and subject to
            this, may normally be one month for periods of grants upto three months; two months, for
            periods of grants upto six months; three months, for periods of grants upto a year; and
            six months for longer period of grants.
            (ix) When it is proposed to grant to a club land within the compound of a Government
            office or a residence, the site as well as the plans and estimates relating to any
            buildings, structures, badminton or tennis courts, etc., which the club proposes to
            erect should be approved by the Executive Engineer in order to ensure that such
            buildings, structures, or courts, etc., are in keeping with the layout of the Government
            buildings. Copies of the plans of the site, buildings, etc., as approved by the
            Executive Engineer should be submitted with the proposals for the grant. It should be
            made clear in the order of the grant that the grant will be recoverable at 24 hours
            notice.
            (x) Renewal of grants can be sanctioned only by the authority competent to sanction the
            grant in the first instance.
            (xi) No attempt can be made to prescribe standard rates for the various purposes for
            which land may be granted. The determination of the charge is therefore left to the
            discretion of the authorities who are competent to sanction the grant. The following
            general principles should, however, be observed in fixing the rates of charge as far as
            possible:—
            (a) Recreation purposes:—In the case of clubs consisting entirely of non- gazetted
            officers and of playgrounds required for educational institutions, nominal charges may
            be levied. In other cases except in municipalities and in the City of Hyderabad the
            terrain assessment or ground-rent on the site, or, if the land has not been assessed,
            the land revenue that is being levied on similar ryotwari land in the village or its
            neighbourhood should be charged. Special reasons should be given if any concessional
            treatment is recommended. Subject to the general concession indicated in favour of
            non-gazetted officers and educational institutions, a suitable charge should be levied
            in respect of each grant in municipalities and in Hyderabad city.
            (b) Trade purposes:—The full competitive rent should be levied as the charge for the
            occupation. By full competitive rent is meant the rent which the site would fetch in the
            open market if offered subject to the conditions stipulated by Government.
            (c) Touring cinemas, circuses or dramatic companies:—A reasonable fixed daily charge
            should be levied in accordance with the rates to be prescribed by the Collector.
            Collectors should fix for each village and town in their districts the rate of charge
            per square yard or ground or cent that should be levied. The rates will depend upon the
            importance of the village or town and situation of the land. There are, in each villages
            or town particular sites in which entertainments are usually held. The Collector will
            fix the rates for each of these sites. When other sites are applied for, the Collector
            should be addressed for orders as to the rate to be levied.
            (d) Laying of pipe lines:—A track rent should be levied on the scales specified below :

            Major Municipalities Rs.70 per K.M. or 7 paise per metre 3

            Minor Municipalities Rs.50 per K.M. or 5 paise per metre 2

            Other towns Rs.35 per K.M. or 3 ½ paise per metre I

            Rural areas Rs.35 per KM. or 2 ½ paise per metre 1

            In Hyderabad city, however, track rent, should be levied at the rate of Rs. 300 per
            kilometre, except in cases of renewal of existing grants for which the old rates of Rs.
            250 or Rs. 300 per kilometre as the case may be should be charged [172(d) newly
            substituted].
            (c) Occupation of lands for unremunerative public or private purposes
            The annual charge should be fixed at an amount not lower than the assessment or ground-
            rent leviable on the land, subject to a minimum of Re. 1.
            Municipal taxes:—In Hyderabad city and in mufassal municipalities, the charge for
            occupation will consist of two parts; the first part will be a specified sum fixed with
            reference to the instructions in sub-Paragraph (i) above, while the second part will
            consist of another specified sum to be levied on account of the municipal taxes payable
            by the Government in respect of the property covered by the grant. In the event of the
            Corporation or the municipality concerned varying its demand, the right to revise the
            second part of the charge and to collect any further sum due as result of such revision
            should be reserved in the order of grant. The two parts of the charge will be payable by
            the grantee simultaneously either in a lump sum or in instalments as may be specified in
            the order of grant.
            Levy assessment and water-cess :—The annual charge for the occupation shall be the
            assessment fixed already in the case of assessed land. If it is not an assessed land, it
            shall bear the same assessment as is borne by similar land in the vicinity. Such
            assessment shall be liable to revision from time to time in accordance with the rules in
            force at the time of such provision. Water-cess will be leviable in addition in
            accordance with the Andhra Pradesh (Andhra Area) Irrigation Cess Act (Act VII of 1865)
            and the rules framed thereunder.
            (xii) Any modifications in the form of grant should be made in consultation with the
            local Government pleader.
            (xiii) Immediately the grants are sanctioned, the period of grant and the rent to be
            recovered should be noted in the Miscellaneous Property Register maintained by the Sub-
            divisional Officer in all cases.

            It is a fundamental rule that no work shall be begun unless a properly detailed design
            and estimate have been sanctioned, allotment of funds made, and orders to begin issued
            by competent authority. Provision in the budget conveys no authority for outlay. The
            exceptions are petty works (see Paragraph 108), repairs of the nature described in
            Paragraphs 1 10(u) and 147 and cases of real emergency which must be reported
            immediately to the authorities competent to accord administrative approval and technical
            sanction. Similarly, the sanction of a design and estimate by any authority, whatever,
            conveys no permission to start expenditure unless funds have been provided for the
            expenditure by a competent authority.
            Further, no liability may be incurred, and no officer may accept a contract for and
            work, until an assurance has been received from the authority competent to provide funds
            that such funds will be allotted before the liability matures.
            Note :— The officers in charge of divisions in Agency tracts shall have powers to grant
            bonuses to gang mazdoors who complete a certain work entrusted to them within a fixed
            time upto a limit of Rs.50 or 5 percent of the total wages ordinarily paid to them for
            that work, whichever is less.

            No formal agreement is necessary in regard to petty works and repairs, the estimated
            cost of which is Rs. 1,000 or less, but even in these cases there should be some written
            understanding—though not in any prescribed form—specifying prices and rates.
            Note (1) :- In the Agency tracts, payment may be made to piece-workers on first and
            final bills costing Rs. 500 and less without regular agreement being entered into, even
            though the total value of the work done or supply made by each piece-worker in
            connection with a work may exceed Rs. 1,000/- when the first and final payment to the
            piece-worker or supplier does not exceed Rs. 200/-, even a written understanding will
            not be insisted on. In divisions not in the Agency tracts, no formal agreements are
            necessary in cases involving ‘first and final’ payments which do not exceed Rs. 200/-.
            But, some written understanding specifying prices and rates will still be necessary,
            except in cases when the “first and final” payments do not exceed Rs. 50/-.
            Note (2) :— Rates and taxes and watchmen’s wages provided for in annual maintenance
            estimates should be excluded from the total amount of estimates for the purpose of
            deciding whether an agreement should be taken in the case of repair estimates for
            buildings.

            (a) When a contractor refuses to execute work at the rates provided in his piece-work
            agreement, then, the agreement should be terminated and the work measured up and paid
            for at the rates in the sanctioned agreement enforcing or not as the case may be, the
            forfeiture of the security deposit. The work should not then be given out at higher
            rates, unless open tenders have been called for and the most favourable rates obtained.
            Note :— If, however, it is found necessary in any case to give out the balance of work
            at higher rates to another contractor without calling for open tenders, whether on
            account of urgency or any other reason, the previous approval of the next higher
            authority above that which accepted the original cancelled agreement should be obtained.
            (b) Revision of rates in accepted agreements of any kind, during the currency of such
            agreements is normally prohibited. In cases, however, where the Executive Engineer
            considers there are sufficient reasons to revise rates in current agreements, then the
            sanction of the authority above that which accepted the agreements should be obtained,
            placing on record with the agreement the reasons for such revision and effect of the
            same on the total amount of work to be done under the concerned items and on the total
            amount of the work to be done under the agreement. Whenever revised rates in any
            agreement are sanctioned, the increased rates will have effect only from the date of
            sanction of such revised rates, unless it is specially started by the sanctioning
            authority that they should have retrospective effect.
            Revision of rates in current agreements — provision under
            Para 176(b) — Clarification
            Para 176(b) lays down that revision of rates in accepted agreements of any kind during
            the currency of such agreements is normally prohibited. However, in cases where the
            Executive Engineer considers that there are sufficient reasons to revise rate in current
            agreements, sanction of the authority above that which accepted the agreement should be
            obtained placing on record along with the agreement the reasons for such revision and
            the effect of the same on the total amount of the work to be done under the concerned
            items and on the total amount of the work to be done under the agreement.
            It may happen that an agreement is entered into by a Superintending Engineer after the
            tender is accepted by the Government. A point has been raised whether in such cases, it
            would be correct if the Chief Engineer being the authority next higher to the
            Superintending Engineer who entered into the agreement, revises the rate in the current
            agreement in items of Para 176(b) of the ‘D’ Code.
            The Government have examined the issue. It is clarified that any modification of the
            rates should be approved by the authority higher than that which originally accepted the
            rates. If the tender is accepted by the Government, modification of rates should be done
            only with the prior approval of the Government. Modification of the rates by the
            competent authority should be with the concurrence of the contractor, who is the other
            party to the agreement.
            The Government also direct that the power of departmental officers to revise rates
            should be limited to rectification of bonafide mistakes or errors in original agreement
            such as electrical or typographic or typographical errors.
            (Memo.No. 261-Y/72-3, P.W.D., Dt. 21-7-1972)
            (c) In all cases, as in (a) and (b), it must be observed that the Code rules governing
            such estimates revisions as may be involved, are complied with.
            (d) The corrections in agreements should be attested under dated initials by the
            accepting authority also, not only to indicate his acceptance of the altered rates, but
            also to prevent any tempering with agreements after approval.
            (e) In all cases in which work not covered by the original agreement is ordered the
            rates for such items of work should be settled as laid down in clause 7 of the
            conditions printed in the form of piece-work agreement or clause 63 of the Preliminary
            Specification of the A.P. Detailed Standard Specifications. Such extra items of work
            should not be ordered by the Executive Engineer on his own responsibility, if the

            higher authority.
            Supplemental rates should be deducted in the following manner
            For items directly deductable from similar items the rate should be arrived at by adding
            or subtracting the cost of cement or steel, etc.
            For new items which do not correspond to any item in the agreement the new rate is the
            estimated rate plus or minus the overall tender percentage.

            (a) If in any case, whether on grounds of urgency or otherwise, an executive officer is
            required to carry out a work for which no estimates have been sanctioned or for which no
            financial provision exists (whether estimates have been sanctioned or not) the orders of
            the officer authorizing the work should be conveyed in writing. On receipt of such
            written orders the officer who is directed to carry out the work should immediately
            intimate to the audit officer concerned that he is incurring a liability for which there
            is no provision or inadequate provision of funds and should, at the same time, state
            approximately the amount of liability which it is likely he will incur by compliance
            with the written orders which he has received. The Audit Officer will then be
            responsible for bringing the facts instantly to the notice of the Chief Engineer
            concerned, except the irregularities committed by a Chief Engineer himself, which should
            be reported direct to the Government. The Chief Engineer will report to Government any
            cases that call for disciplinary action or failure to comply with the Code. The
            Accountant General should also report to Government any cases in which he considers the
            action taken by the Chief Engineer inadequate. There will be no hesitation on the part
            of Government in forcing disciplinary action against any officer—administrative or
            executive—who may fail, or delay to comply with these orders.
            (b) A provision of 1 per cent shall, be made towards audit charges in the estimates for
            irrigation projects for which capital and Revenue accounts are maintained.
            Note 1 :—The provisions of above Paragraph will be relaxed in the case of the famine
            relief works, but this does not relieve officers from the responsibility of obtaining
            the necessary sanction to a revised estimate and additional appropriation as soon as
            they can forsee how far an estimate is likely to be exceeded.
            Note 2 :—The report to be sent to the Audit Officer, with reference to the above
            Paragraph, should be prepared in the form indicated below :

            If, in the case of a work executed on the contract or piecework system, the
            circumstances are so emergent that it is impossible to enter into a formal contract or
            agreement, the officer on the spot who starts the work should enter into a piece—work
            agreement atleast in the first instance. This form of agreement is particularly suitable
            as it is terminable in case the higher authorities, who are competent to sanction the
            proper agreement in the standard form, disapprove. When the circumstances are so
            emergent that even a piece work agreement cannot be signed, it will be sufficient to
            have a written order for the work signed both by the piece worker or the contractor and
            the officer on the spot. There should, however, be no avoidable delay in preparing a
            proper estimate and an agreement in the standard form and in obtaining the sanction of
            the competent authority. The detailed procedure to be followed in such cases is
            indicated in Appendix XI to this Code.

            The rules in this section regarding the existence of a sanctioned estimate and the
            allotment of funds in the budget are applicable even in the case of civil works in
            charge of civil officers acting as Public Works disbursers. When an estimate has been
            sanctioned and funds have been allotted, a civil officer may arrange for the execution
            of the work.
            Works executed by civil officers acting as Public Works disbursers are generally likely
            to be of a petty nature and constructed on standard designs. Civil officers may,
            however, apply to the Superintending Engineer of the circle to depute an officer to
            examine any work when in progress or when completed and to make a general report as to
            whether the work is being satisfactorily carried out or has been completed in accordance
            with the estimate.

            The sanction to an estimate must on all occasions be looked upon as strictly limited to
            the precise objects for which the estimate was intended to provide. Accordingly, any
            anticipated or actual savings on a sanctioned estimate or a definite work should not,
            without special authority, be applied to carry out additional work not contemplated in
            the original project or fairly contingent on its actual execution.
            Savings due to the abandonment of a substantial section of any project sanctioned by any
            authority are not to be considered as available for work on other sanctions without the
            further sanction of that authority.
            A substantial section of a project shall be considered to have been abandoned, if the
            estimated cost of the work in such section is not less than 5 per cent of the total
            sanctioned cost of the project, excluding in the case of irrigation project, the
            estimated cost of the headworks as originally approved.

            In exceptional cases where it is desirable to begin work on a project which has been
            administratively approved, before the detailed estimate for the whole project has been
            prepared, it is permissible for the authority competent to sanction the final technical
            estimates as a whole to accord sanction to detailed estimates for component parts of the
            project subject to the following conditions
            (1) For each such work or component part there must be a fully prepared detailed
            estimate and, in the administrative approval as a whole, there must be a clear and
            specific amount corresponding to the work or component part in question.
            (2) The amount of the detailed estimate must not exceed the amount included in the
            administrative approval by more than 10 per cent.
            (3) The sanctioning authority must be satisfied, before according sanction, that the
            amount of the technical sanction for the whole project is not likely to exceed the
            amount of the administrative approval and that the work of component part in question
            can be appropriately commenced without effecting, or being effected by, any other part
            of the project financially or otherwise.
            Note :—This rule does not apply to estimates for parts or individual buildings unless
            the preliminary estimates for administrative approval have been similarly prepared.

            amendments in the design or estimate, the sanctioning authority should adopt one or
            other of the following courses:—
            (1) Amend the design or estimate in his own office and sanction it, or
            (2) Sanction the parts of the estimate which are approved, subject to conditions (2) and
            (3) specified in Paragraph 183 and call for amended details estimates for the other

            Advances to contractors are as a rule prohibited, and every endeavour should be made to
            maintain a system under which no payments are made except for work actually done.
            Exceptions are, however, permitted in the following cases
            (a) Cases in which, in the interest of work, it is absolutely necessary to make petty
            advances— see Paragraph 315, A.P. Public Works Accounts Code. In such cases subordinates
            in charge of works, sub-divisional officers and Executive Engineers are authorized to
            make advance upto a limit of Rs. 50, Rs. 100 and Rs. 250, respectively. They should,
            however, take the necessary precautions to secure the Government against loss.
            Note 1 :— The limit referred to above apply to each work and not to each individual
            workman employed on a work.
            Note 2 :— In the case of works in the Agency tracts, the limits upto which the three
            classes of officers referred to in the above rule can make advances to petty-piece
            workers shall be Rs. 100, Rs. 200 and Rs. 50, respectively. These limits shall apply to
            each individual piece-worker.
            (b) Electrical works executed on contract :—The Electrical Engineer may sanction an
            advance of eighty per cent on the value as certified by him, according to the terms of
            clause 20 of the general conditions of contract printed in Public Works Department, Form
            No.11—20.
            (c) In all other cases the State Government may, in exceptional circumstances, authorize
            such advance as may be deemed indispensable, but the state officers must take the
            necessary precautions for securing Government against loss and for preventing the system
            from belonging general or continuing longer than is absolutely essential.
            (Powers as delegated in G.O.Ms.No.1007, Tr. and B., Dt. 5—11—1976)
            (d) Advances to the contractors for acquisition of new machinery required for the work
            upto 75% of their cost limited to 10% of contract value for works valued upto Rs. 10
            lakhs each, and 6% of contract value for works costing more than Rs. 10 lakhs each may
            be given, if asked for by the contractor. The money advanced under this clause is
            subject to payment of interest by the contractor at the prevailing commercial bank rate.
            The machinery for which the advance is paid should be got hypothecated to the Government
            and also got insured at the cost of the contractor. The advance, together with interest,
            may be recovered from the bills of contractor. Alternatively, the Government may procure
            the machinery required for works by the contractor and sell the same to the contractors
            on hire purchase terms, provided these conditions are stipulated in the tender documents
            at the time of calling of tenders.

            Explanation
            Sanction of advances to contractors as a rule is prohibited. However for some special
            reasons advances have to be sanctioned by Government depending on the merits of each
            case.
            The Government of Andhra Pradesh in consultation with the Accountant General ordered
            that advance payment to the contractors who undertake the execution of major Bridge
            works involving HT. Steel and anchorage cones etc., be made to the extent of 75 per cent
            of the materials brought to the site. The advance payment should be made only after the
            contractor executes an indemnity bond.
            (G.O.Ms.No. 510, PWD, Dt. 14—3-1962)
            The Government further decided in G.O. Ms. No.5 12, PWD, dated 19—5—1973 that the
            material brought to site should be imperishable in nature and a formal agreement should
            be drawn so that the Government can secure a lien on the materials. Payment of the
            advance should be made only on the certificate of the Executive Engineer. No interest
            will be charged on this type of advance.
            Government also decided to sanction advances for purchases of new machinery of special
            type which the contractors are not generally supposed to possess subject to the
            following conditions:
            (a) In respect of contracts exceeding 10 lakhs only any loan may be given on machinery
            brought to site at 75 per cent of purchase price.
            (b) Interest should be charged at Reserve Bank of India rate plus 3 per cent.
            (c) The Machinery should be hypothecated to the Government and Bank Guarantee obtained.
            (d) The advance together with interest should be recovered by the time 80 per cent of
            the contract value is completed.
            (e) The probability of granting loans should be indicated in the tender notices.

        <para_desc>

            Besides the rules in Paragraphs 201 to 205, the following are specially applicable for
            works financed wholly from non-Government funds :—
            (1) The design and estimates must be drawn up in consultation with the administering the
            funds, and must also be approved by the Public Works Department authorities like any
            ordinary public work.

            (2) A written approval to the estimate and design as well as an understanding that the
            Public Works Department does not accept any responsibility for unavoidable and
            reasonable excesses caused by any rise in prices, authorized deviations, losses by fire
            or theft or other unforeseen factors, should be obtained from the administrators of the
            funds before starting work. Alterations in design should be similarly dealt with.

            (3) The officer incharge of the work should report at once to his superiors and to the
            contributors, any anticipated excesses and give full information regarding the progress
            of expenditure, so that there may be no responsibility for Government if the work has to
            be stopped later on for want of funds.

            (4) The authorities undertaking such works should see that both parties understand
            clearly their mutual responsibilities.

            (5) Where the works is of such magnitude or there are special circumstances justifying
            it, an agreement should be drawn up under legal advice.

        </para_name>
        <para_desc>

            (1) These orders and rules apply only to the construction and maintenance of new works
            in connexion with a Government irrigation system, the cost of which works is defrayed,
            in whole or in part, by the voluntary contributions of interested parties. They do not
            apply to works done by a private person at his own expenses in connexion with any field
            channel which is private property.
            (2) No works in connexion with Government irrigation system will be undertaken save with
            the previous sanction, in writing, of the Government or of an officer of the Public
            Works Department authorised as shown in Rule (5) below and except on the conditions
            mentioned in Rules (6) and (7).
            (3) The actual execution of such works, except those mentioned in Rule (4) below, when
            sanctioned, will be undertaken by the Public Works Department as contribution works
            (vide Rule I under Paragraph 470, A.P. Public Works Account Code); and all such works
            inclusive of those mentioned in Rule (4) below when constructed, shall be deemed to be
            works constructed by, and belonging to Government.
            (4) In the cases of bridges, culverts, bathing-ghats, or rams required by
            municipalities, zilla parishads, panchayat samitis or village panchayats constituted
            under the A.P. Gram Panchayats Act, 1964, the design and location of each work require
            the approval of the officer of the Public Works Department authorized to accord
            technical sanction to an estimate for a Government work of a similar nature and
            estimated cost. The agency by which the work will be executed will be the Public Works
            Department or Engineering staff of the Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samithis and
            Panchayats concerned according as the Superintending Engineer, or in cases beyond the
            Superintending Engineer’s powers, the Chief engineer may decide. If the Zilla Parishad,
            Panchayat Samitis and Gram Panchayats has borne the entire cost of construction, it will
            also bear the full cost of maintenance.
            Note :—Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samitis, Panchayat or Municipalities may be allowed to
            execute such works costing Rs.2,500 and less provided that the execution is supervised
            by the Public Works Department or by the Engineering staff of the Zilla Parishad,
            Panchayat Samithi or Municipality as the case may be.

            (5) The Chief Engineer and Superintending and Executive Engineers are authorized to
            record both administrative and technical sanction to all estimates for contribution
            works for irrigation and subsidiary purposes to be executed by the Public Works
            Department upto the limits of their powers laid down in Paragraphs 416, 420 and 430 of
            the A.P. Public Works Department Code, subject to the condition that the construction of
            the proposed works has been previously approved by the Collector of the district.
            (6) Before the sanction is accorded to the carrying out of any contribution works, other
            than those referred to in Rule (4) the contributor or their authorized representatives
            must sign an agreement duly stamped in the prescribed form — vide Appendix VIII—A of the
            A.P. Public Works Department Code.
            Note :—A11 such agreements should be registered and sent to the Director of State
            Archives, Hyderabad for safe custody.
            (7) Superintending and Executive Engineers are permitted to undertake the maintenance of
            contribution works subject to the limit of their powers to sanction similar repair or
            maintenance estimate in respect of ordinary works and subject to the following
            conditions:—
            (a) In the case of contribution works for which the Government have not contributed as
            much as half the original cost of construction, the repair works may, if the sanctioning
            officer considers it desirable be carried out at public cost if the amount does not
            exceed Rs. 50 in each case in any one year.
            (b) In the case of works for which Government have contributed half or more than half
            the original cost, the works of maintenance and repairs may similarly be carried out at
            public cost without any specified limit.
            Sanction to carry out works of maintenance under this rule should be given only when the
            necessity for such works arises and not when the original contribution works themselves
            are sanctioned.
            Where the cost of maintenance is to be recovered, in part or in whole, from the
            interested parties, the amount required should be recovered before any repairs or works
            of maintenance are commenced.
            (8) A deposit of Rs. 30 will be recovered from the contributors before plans and
            estimates for any contribution works are prepared by the officers of the Public Works
            Department. In cases where the Executive Engineer considers this amount unsuitable, he
            will address the Superintending Engineer. An agreement duly stamped will be obtained
            from the applicants in the prescribed form (vide Appendix VIII—B of the A.P. Public
            Works Department Code) to the effect that unless the work is dropped owing to the
            objection of third parties, the deposit will be forfeited if the applicants withdraw
            after the preparation of plans and estimates. This rule does not apply to works asked
            for by local bodies. In such cases when the Public Works Department prepare plans and
            estimates for works to which a local body has agreed to contribute, that body should pay
            2¼ per cent of the estimated cost of work (subject to a minimum of Rs. 10) for the
            preparation of plans and estimates and 1 per cent of the estimated cost of the work
            (subject to a minimum of Rs. 5) for their security. If the works are eventually executed
            by the Public Works Department, the fees levied on this scale be adjusted towards
            centage charges. The fees, will not be refunded in any circumstances.

            (9) No charges on account of establishment and tools and plant will be made on outlay on
            new original works which are undertaken in the interest of Government, and to which
            local bodies or private persons or bodies contribute, either wholly or in part. But the
            lump-sum contributions made by these bodies or persons in such cases should invariably
            be distributed, for accounts purposes, into two parts (laid down in Paragraph 477 of the
            A.P. Public Works Account Code), the one representing a share of works expenditure and
            the other the amount chargeable on that share as establishment and tools and plant
            charges, calculated according to the percentage fixed in Rule 6(iv)(a) of Appendix 7 of
            the A.P. Public Works Account Code. No charge for audit accounts should be levied in
            such cases.
            In the case of other works, i.e., works which are not required in the interest of
            Government, but are carried out on behalf of private individual or bodies, Z.P., P.S.,
            Municipalities constituted under the Gram Panchayat Act, 1964 and also works which are
            in the nature of maintenance of existing works, percentage charges as shown in the
            margin.
            *13 per cent on works outlay for establishment,
            1 per cent on works outlay for tools and plant,
            1 per cent on works outlay for Audit and Accounts establishments,
            1 per cent on works outlay for pensionary charges.
            *Will be levied where the cost amount to Rs. 1,000 or over, percentage charges will also
            be levied on such works costing less than Rs. 1,000/- unless the levy is specifically
            remitted by the State Government.

            (1) The following rules will apply to works for which contributions are recoverable on
            account of the joint ownership or interest, possessed by the Government and other
            concerned parties. A list of the irrigation or the navigation works which serves more
            than one interest, e.g., Government, private persons or local bodies and showing the
            various irrigation systems and the shares of contribution payable by the various
            interested parties towards the maintenance charges of such systems will be issued
            periodically by the Chief Engineer for Irrigation.
            (2) In these cases centage charges should be recorded on the amounts of contributions at
            the rates specified in the sub-paragraph under Rule 9 of Paragraph 207.
            (3) When an estimate for a contribution work included in the list is framed, the
            contributors should be furnished with copies of abstract estimate and the report showing
            the need for the work and asked to pay their shares together with centage charges
            thereon in advance, a reasonable time being allowed for offering their remarks before
            the work is commenced. In the event of their refusing to pay the amount the work should
            be carried out by the Government, if it seems expedient to do so. In such case, a
            separate account should be maintained showing the items which are covered by centage
            charges, for the purpose of production in Court, if recovery by civil suit is necessary.
            On the completion of the work a second notice demanding payment of the appropriate
            contributions together with interest thereon from the date of that notice till the date
            of payment should be issued immediately after the works are completed and paid for. If
            the contributions are not paid before a specified date, the amount should be recovered
            by a civil suit.
            (4) The case of other contribution works not included in the list of contribution works
            but for which landholders are by equity bound to pay should be decided on their merits
            and the works should not be put in land until necessary agreements are concluded with
            them and the contributions are recovered.

            (5) Urgent contribution works such as repairs of damages caused by floods may, after due
            notice to the contributors, be carried out to the extent absolutely necessary, immediate
            steps being taken to cover the contributions in consultation with the Collector of the
            district. The authority sanctioning the work should satisfy himself that the repairs are
            urgent and essential and should record his opinion in writing to that effect. Any work
            that can safely be postponed should not be carried out before contributions are
            recovered.
            (6) In the case of works for which Government have agreed to contribute and which other
            interested parties carry out, the parties should be required to give at least a
            fortnight’s information in advance to the commencement of the work and in the case of
            really urgent work to inform the Executive Engineer and the Sub-divisional Officer
            within three days of the commencement of the work.
            Note 1 :— The above rules do not apply to cases where Indian States are concerned and
            such cases should be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the special agreements
            concluded with them in the case of each work.

            Under the Kudimaramat rules, when ryots who are responsible for the clearance of
            prickly-pear from tank bunds and channel banks fail to do so, the procedure to be
            followed should be—
            (1) to call on the villagers concerned to do the work as laid down in Board’s Standing
            Order No. 86, Paragraph 6
            (2) to get a report of their failure to do it if they decline
            (3) to hold an auction in the village itself for the lowest bid for the work and to get
            the village panchayat to accept the sum ; and
            (4) to follow the procedure prescribed in Local Ruling 3 under Article 45 of the A.P.
            Accounts Code, Volume III, for the accounting of expenditure incurred by the Public
            Works Department, in such cases.
            The forms of agreement for adoption in cases where prickly-pear bushes, trees, etc.,
            have to be cleared from Government irrigation sources, is given in Appendix XVI.

            Note 1 :— Estimate for removal of prickly-pear will be sanctioned under “ordinary
            repairs”, the countersignature of the Collector of the district being obtained in cases
            where the amount has to be recovered from the ryots under “Kudimaramat”,

            Note 2 :— In village where panchayats do not exist the procedure indicated in Board’s
            Standing Order No. 86, Paragraph 6, should be followed and the auction conducted, if
            necessary, with the help of the village officials.

            he is liable to pay the full rent for the residential portion of the building from the
            date it is occupied by him till the date of his vacating the portion of the building.
            When an officer, to whom a portion of the building is allotted as residence, is

            It is the duty of the Executive Engineer to endeavour to get tenants for public
            buildings not immediately required for Government use. They should generally be felt
            from month to month, but a lease may be given with the Chief Engineer’s sanction. A
            clause in the agreement should be added, when necessary, to enable the Executive
            Engineer to terminate the lease at short notice in case the building is required by
            Government.

            Public buildings let to private individuals should not be altered or enlarged At
            Government expense to suit the tenant, and persons occupying public buildings on rent
            are prohibited from making and alterations even at their own expense, except with the
            express concurrence of the Executive Engineer. The fact of any additions or alterations
            being made by the tenant confers no right of ownership on him, nor can the fact of the
            occupant having made additions or alterations at his own expense be considered as giving
            him any claim to a set-off against, or diminution of rent. These conditions should be

            (i) Whenever a Government building (residential or non-residential) is likely to fall
            vacant, the occupant of the building immediately before the actual vacancy occurs or the
            head of the office to which the occupant belongs, should, on the date on which the
            building falls vacant, give notice of the vacancy direct to the Chairman of the
            Municipal Council concerned or the Commissioner of the Corporation of Hyderabad, the
            President of the Panchayat Board concerned as the case may, a copy of such notice being
            simultaneously sent to the Executive Engineer of the division concerned to enable him to
            claim remission. The head of the office mentioned above shall take similar action on the
            first day of every succeeding half-year, if the building continues to be vacant even
            then. The Executive Engineer shall thereafter, in due course, claim remission of
            municipal or house-tax in case when the vacancy lasted for thirty or more consecutive
            days under Section 87 of the A.P. District Municipalities Act, 1965, or the A.P. Gram
            Panchayats Act, 1964, or for sixty or more consecutive days under Hyderabad Municipal
            Corporation Act, 1955 as the case may be. The officer paying the tax for a vacant
            building should ascertain that remission of tax has been claimed for the period that the
            building was vacant.

            (ii) In the case of vacant buildings which are taken over by the Roads and Buildings
            Department from other departments and which continuous to remain in the charge of the
            Roads and Buildings Department, it shall be the duty of the Section Officer concerned to

            immediately they are taken over and thereafter on the first day of every half-year, if
            the buildings continue to be vacant then, a copy of such notice being simultaneously
            sent to the Executive Engineer concerned.

            (iii) When a Government building (whole or part) is demolished or destroyed, the
            Executive Engineer concerned should immediately give the requisite notice to the
            Municipality or Corporation, or Panchayat concerned and obtain remission of property-tax
            under Andhra Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1965, Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act,

            concerned about the construction of a new building or the reconstruction of a building
            within thirty days from the date of completion or occupation whichever is earlier. This
            intimation shall, in the case of buildings (residential and non-residential) on which
            the Roads and Buildings Department will have to pay the property tax, be given by the
            Executive Engineer concerned. In the case of other buildings, on which the Roads and

            (ii) In order to avoid delays in the assessment and payment of municipal taxes on new
            buildings constructed by the Roads and Buildings Department, the corporation or the
            local body, as the case may be, shall be informed by the Executive Engineer of the cost
            of a new building within six months of its completion. In cases where it is not possible
            to close the account of a work within six months of its completion provisional figures
            of cost, so far as can be made out at the time, shall be given by the Executive Engineer
            so that the assessment may be calculated on these figures subject to revision when the
            final figures of cost are available.

            Whenever a new building is constructed or an existing building is extended or improved
            in a place where there is public supply of electricity available and it is contemplated
            to provide an electric installation in the building, the estimate should provide for it.
            As soon as the administration approval to a building is obtained and the detailed
            building plans are approved, the Executive Engineer should communicate a copy of the
            approved plans to the Electrical Engineer (General). The Electrical Engineer (General)
            should without delay and in consultation with the Head of the Department concerned
            prepare detailed estimates and plans for full electrical equipment required and obtain
            the countersignature of the Head of the Department on the plans and estimates. The
            Electrical Engineer (General) should then obtain the technical sanction of the higher
            authority if and where such technical sanction is necessary. A copy of the approved
            plans and estimates should then be sent to the Executive Engineer incharge of the
            construction work.

            Similarly, the Executive Engineer concerned will have detailed designs and estimates
            prepared in consultation with the Head of the Department and also where necessary with
            engineering specialist firms, for all constructions, and fittings in connection with
            water supply, sanitation and drainage required. If, in any case, it is considered
            necessary to consult the Sanitary Engineer where his specialised knowledge is essential,
            the Sanitary Engineer will prepare detailed estimates and designs for such items in
            consultation, where necessary, with the Engineering specialist firms.

            The detailed plans and estimates for sanitary and water-supply installations are to be
            countersigned by the Head of the Department who will be at liberty to consult any
            officer of his department and who may also send a representative to the office of the
            Electrical Engineer (General) and to the office of the Executive Engineer, respectively,
            to scrutinize the plans during preparation.

            After such detailed plans and estimates for the electrical and sanitary installations
            are obtained, the Executive Engineer should incorporate them in the detailed plan for
            the building work and obtained competent technical sanction. The actual construction
            work need not wait until this final sanction is ready. It should be started as soon as
            technical sanction to the building work is obtained.

            As soon as the final plans and estimates incorporating details of electrical and
            sanitary installations, are ready, copies thereof should be sent to the Electrical
            Engineer, who will, in cases where tenders have to be called for, take necessary action
            in close consultation with the Executive Engineer as regard the time when he should call
            for tenders and start the electrical work. The Executive Engineer should similarly
            settle at an early date the time when work on sanitary and electrical installation
            should be commenced. Tenders for the building, sanitary and electrical installations
            should all be called for in proper order in a co-ordinated programme, which should be
            settled by the Executive Engineer at the commencement of execution of the work to ensure
            that the use of the building is not delayed on account of failure of the sanitary and
            electrical contractors to complete their works in time.

            It is imperative that there should be close co-ordination between the work of the
            Government servants concerned so that at no time is any delay allowed to occur in the
            preparation of plans and estimates, in obtaining technical sanction, in calling for
            tenders and in the actual execution of the works concerned. The Superintending Engineer
            of the Circle in which the building is situated will be responsible for seeing that the
            various works are carried out at the proper time and that unnecessary delay is avoided
            and he will be held personally responsible for seeing that the above instructions are
            carried out.

            Execution — Original Works :— Private agency should be employed wherever possible for
            the
            carrying out of all original works including minor works. Departmental construction
            which involves the accumulation of stores and the employment of special establishment
            should be avoided, Tenders should invariably be invited when the amount involved in a
            particular contract is Rs. 2,500 or more.

            Repairs (Maintenance) :— Wherever private agency is available, it should be employed.
            Tenders should be invited for the purpose when the cost of repairs is Rs. 2,500 or more.
            Departmental maintenance should be resorted to only where no reliable firms tender, or
            where their tenders are excessive. Departmental repairs should, as a rule, be confined
            to small items.

            In all cases, the contractors should be required to base their tenders or proper
            specifications, etc., of the department.
            In places where electric supply is available to the public, payments may be made in
            advance for service connections to Government buildings, if the supply agencies demand
            such advance payment.

            In cases where heads of departments desire to carry out electrical works departmentally,
            the previous approval of Government should be obtained. After such approval has been
            accorded, they may have detailed plans and estimates prepared through any competent
            agency, may themselves call for tenders and have the works executed by suitable agency.
            Technical advice required for assistance needed in the execution of the Works will be
            given by the Electrical Engineer.
            The expenditure in connection with electrical works executed through private agency by
            heads of departments should be borne by the departments concerned — see Paragraph 95-97
            ibid. Heads of Departments should, however, intimate to the Executive Engineer concerned
            the charges incurred in the Civil Department on account of original works, extensions
            and improvements and repairs separately in order that he may maintain his capital
            accounts correctly.
            Note (1) :—As a general rule, the Executive Engineers concerned shall have charge of the
            electrical installations in all Government buildings whether borne on the Roads and
            Buildings Department books or not [except those which are maintained under the control
            of the Electrical Engineer (General) and Superintendents of Jails and Borstal Schools
            and Certified Schools] and shall carryout the repairs and small extensions thereto with
            the help of the electricians or wiremen employed under them. The expenditure on works
            executed in any building by Executive Engineers should be met from funds provided in the
            Roads and Buildings Department Budget.
            (2) The replacement of electric bulbs including fluorescent tubes only in
            non-residential buildings, in cases of failure of the lights due to defects in the bulbs
            themselves should be attended to by the occupying departments.
            (2-A) [The Departments occupying non-residential buildings can purchase the electric
            bulbs including fluorescent tubes locally as per their requirements on the rate contract
            basis or calling for the quotations and accepting the lowest and debit the cost to their
            contingent grant].

            It is the duty of Executive Engineers to arrange for a systematic inspection of all such
            buildings and monuments in their divisions and to frame estimates for their repairs.
            Archaeological Officers will advice on the proposals submitted by Officers of the
            Department, will recommend the order of precedence, will themselves suggest work of
            restoration, and will pass the plans of all work, estimated for before they are carried
            out by the Roads and Buildings Department. During the execution of a work, the
            Archaeological Officer will assist the department by their advice.
            Note 1 :—The cost of providing and maintaining approach roads to ancient monuments
            should be a State charge.

            Note 2 :— Revenue derived from the bungalows within the forts at Chandragiri and
            Gurramkonda in the Chittoor district (Chittoor Division) should be credited to Central
            Revenues.

            specific sanction of Government to the distribution of cost between the Government and
            the custodians of the temples or monuments, but it is sufficient if the amounts to be
            spent on such works from Government funds are shown in the budget submitted by the
            Superintendent Engineer to the Chief Engineer and are approved by the Government.

            (a) Every public building borne on the Roads and Buildings Department registers should
            be carefully examined once every year by the officers of the Roads and Buildings
            Department as indicated below, such inspections being made in respect of soundness or
            otherwise of the roof and floor timbers in the buildings and in respect of their general
            condition, as laid down in Chief Engineer’s Circular No. 1737/Ac./37, C.P., dated 31st
            August, 1937, which is reproduced at the end of this paragraph :—
            (i) Section Officers to inspect once every year all buildings costing Rs. 25,000 and
            below, both residential and non-residential within their jurisdiction.
            (ii) Sub-divisional Officers to inspect every year all buildings in their jurisdiction,
            costing above Rs. 25,000 and not below Rs. one lakh.
            (iii) Executive Engineers to inspect every year all the buildings in the Division
            costing above Rs. one lakh. (G.O.Ms.No. 4, Tr., R. and B. (Cl), Dt. 4-1-1977)
            Note :— The class of officer who is competent to inspect public buildings should be
            determined with reference to the cost of each individual building and in doing so, each
            of the subsidiary buildings appended to a main building in a compound should be taken
            into consideration separately.

            (b) Every public building not borne on the Roads and Buildings Department register
            costing Rs. 10,000 or more should also be inspected by the Roads and Buildings
            Department Offices in the prescribed manner once in three years. In the case of such
            buildings costing less than Rs. 10,000 arrangements for their inspection will be made by
            the head of the department concerned. If for any reason, a Gazetted Officer of a civil
            department considers, after inspection of a building that investigation by an Engineer
            is necessary, he will move the Executive Engineer of Roads and Buildings Department
            division to depute a suitable officer to inspect the building.
            Note :—This inspection of building costing of Rs. 10,000 or more by the Public Works
            Department Officers, will not apply to the Electricity Department.

            (c) The Executive Engineers, the Sub-divisional Officers and the Section Officers should
            record notes of their inspections in separate registers to be maintained by each of
            them.
            All these registers should be shown to the Superintending Engineer during his annual
            inspection of Division Officers.

            (d) Executive Engineers should inspect, as often as possible, buildings which show
            cracks or definite signs of deterioration and take early steps to effect the necessary
            improvements thereto.

            INSTRUCTION
            (Chief Engineer’s Circular Memorandum No. 1737/Ac/37, C.P., Dt. 31-8-1937)
            1. A case has recently occurred in which a Government building in Madras over 75 years
            old
            suddenly collapsed, resulting in the loss of five lives. After careful enquiry and
            examination, it was found that the collapse was not due to defective roof or floor
            timbers (they were all in good condition), but must have been due to the fact that some
            of the masonry piers supporting the roof and floor were carrying a weight greater than
            bad brickwork could be expected to carry. Calculations of the loads carried by these
            piers showed that they were in excess of what is allowed, nowadays on brick masonry.
            Though they exceeded the safe working load now allowed, the piers could have borne the
            load without crushing if the brickwork was good. Examination of the portions of the
            piers left-standing showed that the brick-work was very poor, the bricks were bad and
            were badly laid in poor mortar. The piers must have suddenly collapsed by crushing and
            this collapse brought down the floors and roofs they were supporting and the fall of
            these in turn brought down other portions of the building. There was no indication that
            the piers were unduly stressed. There were no cracks or any other indication and the
            piers looked quite sound. There was no reason whatever for suspecting that they were
            overloaded.

            2. Cases of collapse of Government buildings, as described above, are very rare, But his
            case forcibly illustrates the necessity for periodic and close examination of buildings,
            especially old ones. The existing orders require the regular inspection of buildings by
            officers and subordinates of this department with reference to their safety as affected
            by the condition of roof and floor timbers — vide Chief Engineer’s Memorandum Nos. 3038-
            C, dated 2nd July, 1898, 3156-C, dated 15th July, 1899, 304-C, dated 12th January, 1920,
            3236, Wks/28-C.P., dated 1st September, 1928 and 1738-A, D/32-37, dated 6th October,
            1932. This is ordinarily a sufficient and reasonable precaution. But the officers of
            this department should in additional also examine the building carefully. They should be
            on the lookout for cracks, even slight ones, or other signs of failure ; and if any such
            are noticed, they should forthwith investigate the causes and take sufficient
            precautionary measures, wherever necessary, to ensure the safety of the buildings. They
            should investigate any cases of overloading of pillars and walls that they notice and
            should be on the look-out for such. In many old buildings posts are overloaded and
            anybody of experience who keeps his eyes open should be able to detect such. The Chief
            Engineer realises that it is not economically practicable to examine all old buildings
            in detail as to the theoretical stability of the various parts of their masonry
            structure, but still considers it necessary to impress upon all ranks of the department
            the imperative necessity of periodic inspection of all Government buildings with
            reference to the instructions laid down in the above mentioned circulars and
            particularly to the instructions given above.

            3. The Chief Engineer hereby also directs that in future, whenever it is proposed to
            acquire a private buildings for Government purposes, the stability of the masonry of the
            building should be especially examined as well as that of its timbers. A report of this
            examination and the results thereof should always be sent with the proposals for the
            acquisition of the building. Generally, it is a bad policy to acquire the old or indeed
            any private buildings badly built as most of them are.

            The rules regulating the provision of residences for Government officials are laid down
            in Fundamental Rules, 45, 45-A, 45-C, which together with the State Government’s
            subsidiary rules are reproduced below for convenience of reference. The rules apply to
            residences leased, acquired or constructed at the expense of the State Government and
            supply to an officer under its administrative control. They apply also to residences
            belonging to the Central Government but under the control of the State Government acting
            as agent to the President, which are supplied by the State Government to Government
            servants under its administrative control but paid from Central revenues.

            Note 1 :—When an officer of the Central Government occupies, by official arrangement, a
            residence provided by the State Government, the latter Government shall claim no more
            than the rent which would be recoverable from the officer, under these rules, if he were
            serving under its administrative control.

            Note 2 :—Installation of ceiling fans in Government owned residential buildings shall be

            to the scale laid down in Appendix—XXXII subject to the payment of a monthly rent at a
            flat rate of Rs. 2.25 np. per fan (large or small). This shall be in addition to the
            rent of the building payable by the tenant. The recovery of rent should take effect from
            the date of installation of the fans. In the case of buildings in which the fans were
            installed prior to the orders in G.O.Ms.No. 15, P.W.D., Dt. 4-1-1969, the recovery
            should take effect from 1-10-1961.

            Rent shall be recovered at the same rates from Government servants on transfer who are
            allowed to occupy Government residential buildings beyond their joining time because
            neither the Government servants holding additional charge of the posts nor the incoming
            regular incumbents of the posts for whom the said buildings are intended are in need of
            them for the period of such extended occupation, provided that the new posts to which
            the Government servants are transferred do not carry higher scales of pay. In cases
            where the new posts to which the Government servants are transferred carry higher scales
            of pay, their enhanced rates of pay shall be taken into consideration for calculating
            rent at 10 percent of their emoluments from the actual dates of their joining the new
            posts.
            Rent shall also be recovered at the rates specified in the first paragraph from
            Government servants on transfer, proceeding to new station, during their joining time
            and occupying the Government residential buildings attached to such posts, if vacant
            earlier than actually taking over charge of the new posts, for the period of such
            occupation during the Joining time.

            Note 2 :—In the case of buildings rented by the Government rent for water-supply,
            sanitary and electric installations should be based on the cost of the installations as
            estimated by the Officers of Roads and Buildings Department.
            Instructions under Rule 45-A-V
            Exemptions from payment of rent may be sanctioned, with the previous approval of
            Government, when a building is rendered uninhabitable by reason of extensive repairs or
            for any other cause and is so certified by the Executive Engineer. The latter should
            forward his certificate to the Superintending Engineer who will report to Government
            whether partial or total remission of rent should be allowed and for what period.
            In the case of buildings in charge of the Revenue Department in the Agency tracts, the
            certificate of uninhabitability may be furnished by the Tahsildar or the Deputy
            Tahsildar concerned. The certificate should be countersigned by the Assistant Agent and
            forwarded to Government through the Agent to the Governor. The Agent will report to
            Government whether partial or total remission of rent should be allowed and for what
            period.
            When only a portion of a Government residence becomes uninhabitable, the occupant will
            be allowed the benefit of a remission or rent, only if the standard rent of the building
            excluding the proportionate rent of the portion rendered uninhabitable falls below 10%
            of the occupant’s emoluments.
            Inconvenience caused by petty or ordinary annual repairs is insufficient to warrant a
            remission of rent.
            The total amount of rent and service taxes recoverable from any Government servant in
            respect of a Government residential building owned by Government shall not exceed 10% of
            his emoluments. Government servants entitled to rent free quarters will be exempted from
            the payment of service taxes. The concessional rates of rent fixed for certain
            Government Servants under clause VI(v) of the Manual of Special Pay and Allowances, Part
            I, shall be treated as the limits in force the total of rent and service taxes, i.e.,
            service taxes shall not be recovered from the occupant in addition to the rent at the
            concessional rate.
            Note 1:—Heads of the departments may sanction remission of rent under the above
            instruction upto a limit of Rs. 100/- in each case.
            Note 2 :—A Government servant provided with free quarters may continue to occupy them
            free of rent when he proceeds on leave for a period not exceeding four months provided
            no substitute is appointed in his place or if a substitute is appointed, quarters are
            available for the substitute without any extra expense to Government. If the leave is
            extended beyond the four months limit, rent free occupation of the quarters must cease.
            Note 3 :—A permanent incumbent may during absence on leave or on duty elsewhere, be
            permitted by the Superintending Engineer to store at his own risks, free of rent, his
            furniture and other belongings in his residence when both the conditions specified below
            are fulfilled
            (I) The temporary incumbent does not require the residence and is exempted from the
            payment of rent for it; and
            (2) Arrangements cannot be made to lease the house during the absence of the permanent
            incumbent.
            The concession of storage of furniture and other belongings under this note, free of
            rent is subject to the condition that if a claim for vacancy remission of property-tax
            becomes inadmissible consequent on such storage, an amount equal to be the vacancy
            remission of tax that would otherwise have accrued is recovered from the Government
            servant concerned
            Provided that if a claim for vacancy remission of property-tax or taxes for specific
            services such as water, electricity, scavenging, etc., becomes inadmissible, consequent
            on the storage of furniture etc., an amount equal to the vacancy remission of taxes that
            would otherwise have accrued shall be recovered from the Government servant who enjoyed
            the concession;

            Provided, further that the permission for storage of furniture etc., free of rent shall
            be given for a limited period not exceeding eight months.
            Note 4 :—The consent of the Finance Department may be presumed to have been given to all
            sanctions accorded by Government under this instruction.
            F.R. 45-A-VI. If a residence is supplied with services, other than water-supply,
            sanitary or electric installations and fittings, such as furniture, tennis court, or

            B.II. For the purposes of sub-clause (b) of clause III, the capital cost of a residence
            owned by Government shall not include the cost or value of such special services and
            installations (including furniture, tennis courts and sanitary, water-supply or electric
            installations and fittings) as it may contain; and shall be either—

            Provided that—
            (i) [The State Government] may make rules providing the manner in which the present

            specified portion of the capital cost of a residence—
            (1) when a portion of the residence must be set aside, by the Government servant to whom
            the residence is allotted, for the reception of official and non-official visitors
            visiting him on business, or

            Government in respect of such residence.
            (b) In the case of residences owned by Government, the standard Licence Fee shall be
            calculated on the capital cost of the residence, and shall be a “percentage of such
            capital cost equal to such rate of interest as may from time to time be fixed by [the
            Governor] plus an addition for municipal and other taxes in the nature of house or
            property tax payable by Government in respect of the residence and for both ordinary and
            special maintenance and repairs, such addition being determined under rules which [the
            State Government] may make.
            (c) In all cases, standard Licence Fee shall be expressed as standard for a calendar
            month and shall be equal to one-twelfth of the annual Licence Fee as calculated above,
            subject to the proviso that, in special localities or in respect of special classes of
            residence [the State Government] may fix a standard Licence Fee to cover a period

            fee of the residence being increased.
            B.IV. When Government supplies a Government servant with a residence leased or owned by

            Before submitting a proposal to Government for the construction of a residence for a

            officer.The lease should originally provide that the lessor will execute all structural
            repairs before the building is occupied and will carry out all necessary conditions,
            alterations and repairs.

            For the purpose of the foregoing rules Government residential buildings will be divided
            into two Classes
            Class I —Buildings which will ordinarily be occupied by officers liable to pay the full
            standard rent subject to the limit of 10 per cent of their emoluments. (See Fundamental
            Rule 45-A-IV(b))
            Class 11:—Buildings from which recovery of the full standard rent is not expected, i.e.,
            buildings which will ordinarily be occupied by officials who are entitled to
            accommodation rent free or at rates reduced under Fundamental Rule 45-A-V.

            Note 1 :— The fact that a building of Class I is occasionally occupied by a tenant who
            is entitled to accommodation rent-free or at a reduced rent, will not justify its
            removal from Class I to Class II, and vice versa a building in Class II should not be
            transferred to Class I whenever it is occupied by a tenant who may be required to pay
            rent in accordance with the rules. Buildings should be transferred from one class to the
            other only when there is a permanent change in the conditions under which they will
            ordinarily be rented. Transfers should be made only under the orders of Government and
            should have effect in all cases from the commencement of a financial year.

            Note 2:- Buildings for which rent is recovered for a season only, such as those meant
            for the migratory staff of Government should be shown under Class I if they are allotted
            to officers liable to pay the full standard rent (limited to 10 per cent of their
            emoluments). Such buildings may, however, be exhibited under a separate group of that
            class.

            there may be separate lists for each circle of Superintendence, as may be more
            convenient. Separate lists are not required for buildings the rent proceeds of which are

            use, for a continuous period of not less than two months, the standard rent of the
            residence should be reduced, with the sanction of Government, by an amount equal to the
            rent on the capital cost of the well (if such cost is included in the capital cost of
            the building) for the period for which the well is dry or otherwise unfit for use. The
            occupant of the residence should pay either the reduced standard rent or 10 per cent of
            his emoluments, whichever is less, for such periods.

            When any Government building is, under proper authority, let to a private person, rent
            should be regularly recovered for the same at the rates prevailing in the locality for
            similar accommodation belonging to private owners but without the special permission of
            Government, the rent charged for the buildings thus let, in any stations should not be
            less than the rent calculated by taking into account 6% for interest on the book value
            of the building with additions and alterations and of sanitary, water supply and
            electrical installations and fittings in the building plus 1 ½ % on the book value of
            the building, excluding the cost of site, but including cost of sanitary, water-supply
            and electrical installations and fittings to recover capital investment at the end of
            the life of the building plus 4 ½ % for maintenance on the capital cost of the building
            excluding the cost of site and 6 per cent for maintenance on the capital cost of
            sanitary, water-supply and electrical installations and fittings plus municipal or
            panchayat taxes, if any, payable on the building.

            Note 1:- The terms “book value” and “capital cost” used in the paragraph represent (i)
            the actual cost of constructing or acquiring the building plus, (ii) the cost or
            assessed value of the site plus, (iii)(a) in the case of buildings constructed by the
            Public Works Department, departmental charges on the works outlay for establishment
            (including pension) tools and plant and audit and accounts at the rates in force at the
            time of calculation of rent as shown in sub-clause (iv)(d) of Rule 6 in Appendix 7 to
            the Andhra Pradesh Public Works Accounts Code, or (b) in the case of buildings
            constructed by the other departments of Government under Paragraph 97 of the Public
            Works Department Code, departmental charges on the works outlay for establishment, etc.,
            at 6 per cent, and (c) in the case of buildings merely acquired by Government through
            the agency of the Public Works Department, a departmental charges of 3 per cent on the
            gross cost of acquisition.

            Note 2:- The Chief Engineer is authorised to sanction renewals of leases of Government
            buildings let to private persons on the terms originally sanctioned by Government in
            cases where the rent does not exceed Rs. 20 per mensum.

            Note 3:- (i) The standard rent paid for the buildings should be charged to pensioners of
            Government for the first three months from the date of retirement provided their
            continuance in the buildings after retirement is permitted by the Government.
            (ii) If specific permission of the Government is obtained for occupation beyond three
            months rent at local or market rates may be accepted as per Para 275 above. Calculation
            of rent at local rates shall be made quinquennially except where additional amenities
            are provided in the meantime. Where additional amenities are provided, enhanced rent
            will have to be fixed taking into account the cost of the amenities.
            (iii) Where the occupation is without the permission of the competent authority, rents
            should be charged as detailed below
            Interest on capital cost of the buildings plus maintenance charges in addition to the
            rent assessed as per local market rates in accordance with Para 275 above.

            Liability to rent for new buildings and for additions and alterations :—(a) The
            Executive Engineer should fix, under the provisions of Fundamental Rule 45-A-III(b) and
            with reference to special orders if any, passed by Government, the approximate rate of
            rent to be recovered and should give notice thereof to the office for whom the building
            is intended, one month in advance of its probable date of completion. Immediately the
            building is fit for occupation, the Executive Engineer or the Sub-divisional Officer
            concerned should intimate the fact of its completion to the officer concerned. The
            liability to rent commences from a date one week after the date of receipt of the
            intimation by the officer, and the rent should be recovered in accordance with rules,
            whether the building has been occupied within that time or not. The rent so fixed will
            be subject to adjustments later, should the rent finally sanctioned by the competent
            authority under Fundamental Rule 45- A-III(b) differ from that decided upon by the
            Executive Engineer. (b) In the case of additions and alterations to a residential
            building which necessitate a revision of rent the Executive Engineer will fix, in the
            first instance, the revised rate of rent to be recovered, subject to modification and
            the necessary adjustments after the sanction of data statements by the competent
            authority, and will give notice thereof to the tenant within ten days after the
            completion of additions and alterations. The revised rate will have effect from the date
            of completion of the work.
            (c) Revised data statement should be submitted to the competent authority immediately
            after the completion of each work involving an increase to the capital cost of the
            building without waiting, for the completion of works subsequently sanctioned.
            Note 1:- Superintending Engineers are empowered to approve finally, on the certificate
            of the Audit Officer, of data statements for calculating the standard rents of
            Government residential buildings except those which fall under F.R.45-A-II, V(i) and (2)
            (vide Paragraph 263), provided the standard rent is fixed strictly in accordance with
            the instructions in F.R. 45-A-III(a), (b) and (c) and the subsidiary rules thereunder.
            Data statements in which the Audit Officer differs from the Superintending Engineer
            should be submitted to Government for orders.

            of Government residential buildings, the capital cost of which is not known, standard
            rent will be calculated in the above cases by the Superintending Engineers as follows
            When the year of construction or acquisition of a residential building is not known, its
            present value will be taken into account. The rate of interest applicable to the year in
            which the assessment of the capital cost of the building was made for the purposes of

            successor, and will be required to pay the cost of any special white-washing, cleaning
            or other repairs which may be rendered necessary by any improper use of the building. In
            order to give effect to this rule and to see that the quarters have been handed over for
            occupation in thoroughly good order, the Executive Engineer or the Sub-divisional
            Officer should arrange to have each residential building inspected immediately after it
            is vacated. The incoming tenant will also be responsible for bringing to the notice of
            the Executive Engineer any special damage at the time he enters the building.

            Note 1 :—The intention of the rule is that, while repair occasioned by natural wear and
            tear should be carried out at Government cost, damages to Government property which can
            be provide to be due to culpable carelessness on the part of tenants should be charged
            to them.

            Note 2 :—A notice to the above effect should be issued to occupants before they occupy
            their allotted quarters

            Note 3 :-—A list of fixtures in each residential building shall be maintained by section
            officers and in sub-division and division offices and a copy of it shall be hung in each
            building. Whenever change in occupancy of a building occurs the outgoing officer should
            obtain from the incoming officer a receipt for the fixtures handed over and forward it
            to the public works department section officer in charge of the building. If the
            building on being vacated by one officer is not occupied immediately by another, the
            outgoing tenant on vacating the building should obtain a certificate from the Public
            Works Department, Section Officer that all the fixtures noted in the list are present
            and in good order; and, when the building is re-occupied, the section officer should
            obtain from the new tenant a receipt for the fixtures. If any of the fixtures are left
            in a damaged condition the section officer should immediately report the fact through
            the sub-divisional officer to the Executive Engineer who will recover the cost of the
            damaged articles from the outgoing tenant.

            Use of vacant residential buildings as rest house :—Vacant Government residential
            buildings should not be allowed to be used as rest houses, but officers on tour may be
            allowed to occupy temporarily such buildings with the previous permission of the
            Executive Engineer subject to the payment of rent at the rate of 0.50 paise a day in the
            case of a Gazetted Officer and 0.25 paise a day in the case of a non-gazetted officer
            for an occupation of twenty-four hours or a fraction thereof such occupation should not,
            however, be permitted of buildings which would otherwise be eligible for vacancy
            remission of tax under the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Municipalities Act or the
            Andhra Pradesh Gram Panchayat Act, 1964 unless the rent payable is sufficient to cover
            the loss of the vacancy remission.
            Note :— Officers on tour may also be permitted to occupy temporarily non-residential
            Government buildings partially or wholly vacant subject to the same conditions and rates
            of rent as in this paragraph.

            Care of vacant buildings :—If an officer for whom a Government residence is provided
            with or without rent is allowed for his own convenience to live elsewhere, he is
            expected to engage a watchman, to take care of the building. Until a private watchman is
            so employed, the Public Works Department will employ one and recover the cost from
            tenant, when, however, a residence remains unoccupied not purely on account of personal
            reasons but because the post to which the residence is attached vacant or its incumbent
            is exempted both from occupying it and from the liability to rent in the circumstances
            described in Subsidiary Rule 5 to F.R. 45 the following arrangements should be made:—
            (1) If the quarters are expected to be vacant for one month or less the officer on the
            spot discharging the duties of the permanent officer for whom the quarters are intended
            should arrange to dipute a peon or other menial to look after the vacant building and
            garden attached to it.
            (2) If the quarters are expected to be vacant for more than one month the department
            in-charge of the building will employ a watchman at the cost of Government to look after
            the building as well as the garden.
            Note 1 :—The Executive Engineer is authorised to sanction the entertainment of a
            watchman or caretaker in the case of Government residences in his charge. In exercising
            this power the Executive Engineer should ordinarily sanction only the lowest pay of the
            watchman. If, however, it is found absolutely necessary to pay more than the lowest rate
            in special cases, he should record his reasons for doing so.
            Note 2 :—A watchman employed for a vacant residential building need not be discharged,
            when the building is temporarily used as a rest-house by touring officers for not more
            than 15 days, vide also Paragraph 281.

            purposes.

            (4) Bushes and shrubs planted in the ground are the property of the Government and may
            not be cut down or removed from the compound without the concurrence of the Executive
            Engineer, but his concurrence shall not be required for such cutting down, uprooting or
            trimming of any bund or shrub or lopping of any tree as may be necessary for the proper
            maintenance of the garden.

            (5) (a) The Executive Engineer will report to the Superintending Engineer any breach of

            The measurement book, Common Form No. 298 is a most important record since it is the
            basis of all accounts of quantities whether of work done by daily labour, piece-work,
            schedule contract, deviations in a lump-sum contract, or of materials received. It is
            the original record of actual measurement or count. The descriptions must be lucid so as
            to admit of easy identification and check. A reliable record is the object to be aimed
            at as it may have to be produced as evidence in a Court of Law. Rules regarding the
            maintenance of measurement books and the manner of making entries therein are found in
            the Andhra Pradesh Public Works Account Code, Paragraphs 293 and 294.
            Note 1 :— In the case of works, where considerable earthwork has to be done, e.g.,
            excavation of a canal, the quantity of work done shall be determined with reference to
            the levels taken before and after excavation and the final payment to the contractor
            shall be based on the lesser of the two (i.e.) quantities based on pit measurements and
            levels taken. The levels taken in such cases are to be recorded in Level Field Books and
            calculations made after plotting the levels on section sheets, and L.F. Books, Section
            Sheets and Calculation Statements are to be treated as adjuncts to the measurement book.
            Detailed rules regarding the measurement to be taken in the case of earthwork excavation
            are found in Specification 20(A)(h) in Section 3 of A.P.D.S.S.
            The following certificate shall be inserted at the time of passing bills
            Certified that levels recorded in the L.F. Books, levels plotted in section sheets and
            the areas / quantities worked out in the calculation sheets have been checked and found
            correct.
            Note 2 :— Whenever measurement books, change hands, even if it is only from one office
            to another situated in the same building, the receipt of the books should be
            acknowledged in writing by some responsible person of a grade not inferior to that of a
            clerk.
            Note 3:- In the case of job works executed by piece-workers in the Public Works
            Workshops at Hyderabad, Vijayawada and Dowlaiswaram where piece-workers are given the
            works for the amounts of labour estimated for in the work order estimates and agreed to
            by the piece-workers in the form of agreement printed in the work order form (P.W.D.
            IV-6) there is no need to record in a measurement book any measurement of the works done
            or the lump-sum payments made against the agreed amounts. In cases, however, where the
            job work is entrusted to the piece-worker subject to payment to him at a rate agreed to
            with reference to weight or area of outturn, it is necessary to record detailed
            measurements or job works in a measurement book to serve as a basis for making payment
            to the piece-worker.

            Public money in the custody of the department should be kept in strong treasure chests
            and secured by two locks of different patterns. The duplicate keys of divisional and
            sub-divisional cash chests should be placed, under the seal of the Executive Engineer,
            in the custody of the Treasury Officer in the jurisdiction of the division concerned. A
            duplicate key register should be maintained and once a year, in the month of April, the
            keys should be kept apart from the key of the other lock and in a different person’s
            register that they have been found correct. The key of the one lock should be kept apart
            from the key of the other lock and in a different persons’ custody when practicable.
            When there is a police guard, the havildar or other petty officer of the guard should
            usually be the custodian of one set of keys. The chest should never be opened without
            both custodians, being present. The non-commissioned officer or daffedar of the guard
            should always be present when a treasure chest is opened and until it is again locked.
            Whenever a cashier is attached to a division or sub-division, the key or one of the
            locks of the treasure chest will necessarily remain in his possession.

            Note :— The above rules should be strictly followed in offices where cashiers have been
            appointed under Paragraph 300, and where head clerks have been required to furnish
            security under Note 3 to Paragraph 303. In other offices, where iron safe and cash
            chests are embedded in masonry and the cash to be deposited does not ordinarily exceed
            Rs. 500/- a single lock is sufficient. Portable cash chests should always be provided
            with two locks.

            (1) Indenting officer should see that in cases of loss or damage of imported stores,
            claims are promptly made against the shippers contractors or “Marine Insurance”. A loss
            would be chargeable against “Marine Insurance” only when the responsibility for breakage
            or loss cannot be fixed on the shippers for contractors.

            (2) The High Commissioner or Ambassador for India charges ¼ per cent on all stores
            shipped to cover the cost of Insurance, and in cases in which the loss is properly
            chargeable Insurance he arranges to give a corresponding credit to the Department or
            Province concerned by debit to “Marine Insurance”.

            (3) The report of loss or damage should show the particulars contained in the
            instructions on the packing account, viz., description of stores, details of numbers and
            where necessary sizes and quantities when articles are missing, the gross weights, of
            package as received. If no recovery has been made, the facts and the reasons therefor
            should also be reported.

            (4) Marine insurance does not cover after the stores leave the ship’s side, i.e., during
            landing and it is therefore essential that brittle ‘stores such as stoneware pipes,
            etc., should not be landed at open road-sides during certain seasons, such stores should
            be landed at these ports only when the risk of breakage is at a minimum. Indenting
            officers should clearly indicate in their indents whether any of their indented articles
            should be so delivered.

            Note:- It is desirable to make a small allowance for breakage in indenting for
            stone-ware or cast iron pipes.

            It is the declared policy of Government to encourage the purchase in India of articles
            which are either produced or manufactured locally and preference should be given to such
            articles, when the quality is satisfactory and the prices not unfavourable. All indents
            for demands should accordingly be carefully scrutinized by the sanctioning authority
            with a view to judging whether articles are being indented for from Foreign countries
            which could equally economically and satisfactorily be obtained from local
            manufacturers.

            to that limit, the sanction of superior authority being required only when it is desired
            to exceed it. The fixed maximum should be kept at the lowest point compatiable with

            undertaking and obtain his occurrence to the grant of the proposed concession, must be
            obtained. The main criterion is whether the public are benefited by the charity or only
            a few individuals and the concession should not be granted in the latter case. The
            Superintending Engineer’s powers of sanction in this respect are limited to the sale of
            materials, the value of which does not, at the booked value, or market value, exceed
            Rs.300. In all cases where a larger sum is involved the sanction of Government must be

            works outside the stores in the same division.
            (The department should include the tax element also in hire charges of the vehicles to
            avoid real loss to the Government and no Motor Vehicle Tax as such need be paid in
            respect of vehicles loaned to the contractors).
            (1) Ordinarily heavy plant and machinery alone should be let out on hire, light and
            petty tools such as carpenters, blacksmiths, or fitters’ tools should not be hired out
            at all, except as provided in Rule 10, either to Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samithis, to
            Panchayats or the private parties.
            (2) Ordinarily, if plant and machinery are likely to be required for a continuous period
            of three years, the articles required should be purchased outright instead of being
            hired, and on completion of the work, if no longer required, may be offered to the
            officer in charge of the stores, who after examination may, if they are still
            serviceable take them over at a valuation.
            (3) The hire charges payable under these rules should be recovered monthly in advance
            except in the case of Government Departments, Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samithis,
            Panchayats and contractors doing Government work, in which cases they may be recovered
            monthly in arrears,
            A deposit of the full market value or the full original cost of the tools and plant
            whichever is greater, should be taken in all cases from private individuals including
            contractors requiring them for use on non-Government works.
            (4) A formal agreement in the prescribed from vide Appendix—Vu should be entered into by
            the officer in charge of stores for all plant, machinery and tools hired out to Zilla
            Parishads, Panchayat Samithis, Panchayats, Contractors and private parties.
            (5) In addition to the rent payable under these rules, the person hiring the tools,
            plant and machinery should also pay—
            (i) all charges connected with packing, handling in the stores, conveyance and other
            incidental expenses in connection with the despatch of the tools, plant and machinery
            from the stores and return thereto—including freight charges, if any—also erecting and
            dismantling charges;
            (ii) the cost of replacing, missing or broken of repairs necessitated by any definite or
            specific damage.
            Note :— In case where plant and machinery are hired out from the Executive divisions of
            the department the articles should be handed over to the hirer at the place where they
            are stored by the department and he should be left to attend himself to the packing
            conveyance etc., at his cost. If, in any case the Department incurs any expenditure on
            behalf of the hirer by way of handling charges etc., it should be recovered at once from
            the hirer.
            (6) For the purpose of fixing the rates of hire — vide Rule 7—heavy plant and machinery
            shall be divided into three classes:
            Class A —Plant and machinery which in fairly constant use is likely to have a life of 20
            years, e.g., portable steam engines and steam vertical boilers.
            Class B :—Plant and machinery which in fairly constant use is likely to have a life of
            12 years, e.g., steam road-rollers, steam air-compressors, steam concrete mixers,
            internal combustion engines of low speed type, steam hoists, power cranes, rail-track of
            tramway plant and pile driving equipment.
            Class C :—Plant and machinery which in fairly constant use is likely to have a life of
            six years, e.g., all motor-driven machinery comprising of pumps, air-compressors,
            Welding sets, concrete mixers, mortar mills, road-rollers, locomotives, internal
            combustion engines of high speed type and power calyx drills; hand-operated calyx
            drills, gear pumps, hand cranes, mortar mills, boring tools and lock drills rolling
            stock of tramway plant, two- wheeled and four-wheeled trollies, water-carts, separate
            centrifugal pumps, pulsometer, stone crushers, hand-operation concrete mixers, and
            lorries and trailers.
            If at end of the period or life fixed for a plant or machinery in any of the three
            classes mentioned above, it is considered still fit for use, it should be transferred to
            fourth class ‘D’ without value and hire charges at the rate fixed for the class to which
            it originally belonged should be charged whenever it is hired to other division, etc.
            (7) The hire charges for heavy plant and machinery lent to other Public Works Divisions,
            Government Departments, Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samithis, Panchayats and to
            contractors for use on Government Works shall be fixed to cover interest, depreciation,
            repairs on return or overhauling and storage and the annual rates are fixed at :—

            Classs (A) -- Interest (5) -- Depreciation (5) -- Storage and Repairs and renewals on
            account of fair wear (10) -- Total hire charges (20) -- Remarks (On the Original cost of
            the appraised value where the cost is not known, or the probable cost or renewal)


            Classs (B) -- Interest (5) -- Depreciation (8 1/3) -- Storage and Repairs and renewals
            on
            account of fair wear (10) -- Total hire charges (23 1/3) -- Remarks (On the Original
            cost of
            the appraised value where the cost is not known, or the probable cost or renewal)


            Classs (C) -- Interest (5) -- Depreciation (16 2/3) -- Storage and Repairs and renewals
            on
            account of fair wear (10) -- Total hire charges (31 1/3) -- Remarks (On the Original
            cost of
            the appraised value where the cost is not known, or the probable cost or renewal)

            During the period of hire, all repairs except those found necessary owing fair and tear,
            shall be borne by the hirer. In cases where the period of hire is more than two years,
            all repairs due to fair wear and tear during the first two years shall be borne by the
            Government and thereafter by the hirer. In cases where the period of hire is less than
            two years, all such repairs shall be borne by the Government during the whole period.
            Such items, as renewals of bearings, breakage due to a flaw in the metal, shall be
            included among those to be borne by the Government. The decision of the Executive
            Engineer of the division concerned or of the General Superintendent, Public Works
            Workshops and Stores, Hyderabad and Sithanagaram as the case may be, for the time being
            shall be final as to what repairs should be borne by the Government.
            If during the period of hire, it is found necessary to send the plant to the public
            works workshops for repairs all conveyance and incidental charges to and for shall be
            borne by the hirer.
            Note:- Government road-rollers and water-sprinklers may be lent free of hire charges or
            deposits, to piece-workers for the execution of Government works in the agency tracts
            subject to the condition that the sub-divisional officer or the subordinate incharge of
            the works is held personally responsible for the proper use of the plant by the
            piece-worker and for its safe return.
            (G.O.Ms.No. 400, P.W. (Y) Dept., Dt. 25-3-1972)
            When heavy plant and machinery belonging to the Public Works Department is lent to other
            divisions, Government Departments, local bodies and to contractors for use on Government
            works hire charges are leviable at the rates fixed in Para 340(7) of the A.P.W. D’ Code.
            The rate of interest of 5% included in the hire charges is below the Government’s
            borrowing rate and the hire charges do not include P.O.L. costs, crew charges etc.
            (2) The Government consider that the procedure for fixation of hire charges followed in
            the Nagarjuna Sagar Canals and the Nagarjuna Sagar Dam shall be followed in the entire
            Public Works Department including Roads and Buildings Department also. They therefore
            direct that the procedure as indicated in the annexure to the order be followed in the
            entire Public Works Department including Roads and Buildings Department also.
            (3) Even the rates adopted in the Nagarjunsagar Project Organisation require revision in
            view of the increase in the P.O.L. charges, interest rate etc. All the Chief Engineers
            should therefore, revise the hire charges urgently. They should also review the charges
            every year fix suitable rates as already ordered in G.O.Ms.No. 1925, P.W.D., dated 2nd
            August, 1965.
            (8) The monthly rate shall be the annual rate divided by the probable number of months
            the plant is likely to be out on hire during the year which should be fixed by
            estimating the average rate of the wear of the plant after a repair and overhauling. The
            rent so arrived at shall be charged for each complete month. In cases where a plant is
            required by the hirer for fractions of a month where the total period of hire is less
            than one month or is in excess of one or more complete months, rent shall be charged for
            such fractions at 1/20 of the monthly rate perdiem subject to the maximum of the monthly
            rate. In all cases, the period of hire shall count from the date the plant and machinery
            leave the stores to the date they are returned thereto. An exception to the general rule
            of charging rent may be allowed by the Executive Engineer of the division concerned or
            the General Superintendent, Public Works Workshops and Stores, Hyderabad, Sithanagaram
            and Junior Superintendent, PWD Workshops, Dowlaishwaram as the case may be, when the
            interval between the two periods of hire is likely to exceed two clear months, and the
            hirer notifies the fact to the Executive Engineer of the division concerned or the
            General Superintendent, Public Works Workshops and Stores, Hyderabad, Sithanagaram and
            Junior Superintendent. Godavari Headworks Division, Dowlaishwararm, as the case may be,
            who if he has no demand for the Plant in question elsewhere, may allow it to remain in
            the custody of the hirer for the period of idle time, free of rent. The total period of
            idle time permissible between two periods of hire should not exceed six months. No idle
            time of less than two months duration shall be considered except in cases where a such
            small periods of idleness are due to the rectification of repairs caused by fair wear
            and tear or other defects or causes for which the hirer is not responsible. In such
            cases, the Executive Engineer of the division concerned or the General Superintendent,
            Public Works Workshops and Stores, Hyderabad, Sithanagaram and Junior Superintendent,
            Dowlaishwaram as the case may be, may grant exemption from payment of rent. The actual
            idle time for which no rent charges will be made shall be definitely specified in the
            sanction and no extension of the period shall be allowed. The Executive Engineer of the
            Division concerned or the General Superintendent, Public Works Workshops and Stores,
            Hyd., Sithanagaram and Junior Superintendent. Godavari Head-works Division,
            Dowlaishwaram, as the case may be. shall not be called upon to bear any charges for care
            taking or maintenance during the period of exemption from rent.
            Note 1: — In the case of tram lines which have been laid at the expense of the
            Government in connection with the execution of works and which a number of contractors
            are permitted to use at a time for the purpose of conveyance of materials to the work
            site, hire charges shall be levied at a certain rate per unit of material conveyed, as
            indicated in the example given below.
            Rs.
            Total book value of the tram lines and trucks 50,000
            Hire charges at 25 per cent per annum 12,500
            Hire charges per month assuming that the plant can be used for
            only ten months in a year excluding two months as rainy months 1,250
            Taking 25 working days month, hire per day works out to 50
            Average number of trucks that work in a day - 60 Nos.
            At six trucks a unit, 60 trucks can convey 10 units
            Hence hire per unit works cut to Rs. 50/10 or Rs. 5
            In cases where hauling is provided at Government expense the recovery of charges
            therefor will be settled in each case as it arises.
            Note 2 :— ln the case of hire of tools and plant by the Chief Engineer, Public Health on
            water- supply and drainage investigation hire charges should be collected for the actual
            period of use of the articles and the Officers-in-charge of the investigation and other
            similar work should be responsible for fixing the period of levy of such charges in each
            case.
            (9) When heavy plant and machinery is lent to private parties or to contractors for use
            on works other than Government works that rent charged shall be double the rate
            prescribed in Rule 7 above except in the case of boring tools for which the ordinary
            rate of 3 12/3 per cent shall be charged. (Public sector undertaking shall, be charged
            only 20 percent extra prescribed in Rule 7 above, G.O.Ms.No. 1052, TR and Bs, Dt.
            11-9-1975).

            Note: —Railway companies should be treated as private parties for purposes of this rule.
            (10) In cases of real emergency, mamuties, crowbars, axes, baskets and other tools of
            like nature may be hired to Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samithis, Panchayats or to a
            contractor, but such tools must be returned to the store as soon as possible after the
            emergency cases. The hire to be charged under this paragraph will be at the rate of 24
            per cent per annum on the original cost of the tools.
            Note 1 :— No hire charges will be levied from Zilla Parishads in respect of tools sent
            to those parishads from the reserve stock of famine tools in the Public Works Divisions,
            for use on works undertaking by them for the provision of employment for unskilled
            labour.
            Note 2 :— Government tools may be lent, as a special case, to piece-workers in the
            Agency tracts for the execution of Government works in the Agency tracts, free of hire
            charges or a deposit on the responsibility of the Sub-Divisional Officers in charge of
            the works. If any of the tools lent be not returned, full cost with centage should be
            recovered from the pieceworker. The percentage deduction on intermediate bills should be
            sufficient to cover the value of all tools lent.
            Note 3 :— No hire charges will be levied when tents are lent to other Public Works
            Divisions, Government Departments, Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samithis, Panchayats for
            Public and Semi-public purposes. But any cost incurred on account of conveyance pitching
            etc., and of any damages caused to the tents should be collected from the Zilla
            Parishads, Panchayat Samithis and Panchayats. Or if the loan is to a Government
            Department it should be debited to the division or department concerned.
            Note 4 :— No hire charges shall be recovered for the workshops tools and plant used by
            the piece-workers on the workshop jobs entrusted to them.
            (11) The Chief Engineers, Superintending Engineers and Executive Engineers are empowered
            to hire out tools and plant and machinery to Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samithis,
            Panchayats and private parties for the periods specified below subject to the conditions
            laid down in the above rules.
            Executive Engineer : For a period not exceeding three months.

            General :—It is a general principle that Government bear their own risks and do not
            insure Government property. In the case of goods intended from abroad, insurance charges
            are payable by Government only when the purchase price includes cost, insurance and
            freight of the goods as delivered in Andhra Pradesh. If, however the goods are delivered
            to a Government officer in a foreign country and shipped by him to India, such goods
            become Government property as soon as they are taken delivery and should not be insured.
            Special goods such as mathematical and scientific instruments, articles made of glass
            and other fragile articles, should be consigned at railway risk and they should not be
            insured except in case where railway companies insist on insurance as a condition of
            transport.

            of by the Revenue Department under B.S.O.No. 211. It is the duty of the Public Works
            Department Divisional Officers to see that the sales of miscellaneous properties such as
            usufruct of trees, grass, etc., are made periodically to the best advantage of the
            Government. The sales should be made by public auction after the publicity has been

            time as is reasonably necessary for such counting, handing and taking over. In a case

            serious illness or sudden death, an immediate verification of the stores in his personal
            custody should be arranged for by the officer taking over charge under Paragraph 365 of

            be present on account of serious illness, he shall be required to nominate a person who
            will represent him during such verification and sign for him for the correctness of the
            check. If, on such verification any, deficiency is noticed the officer, who left the
            charge suddenly on account of illness, shall be held responsible for the deficiency,
            unless, after his recovery from illness, he is able to account for it from the accounts
            or other records maintained by him. If the charge taken over is that of a deceased
            officer, such deficiency if any, shall be written of by the competent authority.

            satisfied
            (a) There must be good reason to believe that the revenue derived from it will, within

            capital invested calculated at such rate as the State Government may fix from time to
            time, but in preparing a project for sanction no deduction is to be made from the total
            capital outlay on account of anticipated excess of revenue over simple interest
            calculated at the rate of productivity mentioned above.
            Note :— Capital invested includes (I) direct charges, (2) indirect charges, and (3) all
            arrears of simple interest, if any, i.e., balance of total interest calculated at the
            rate for productivity over total net revenue.

            (c) Its classification as a productive works must be duly sanctioned by a competent

            undertaken either for employment of famine relief labour, in which case they are
            generally financed from the Famine Insurance Grant of Fund, or they may be works not
            undertaken for the employment of famine relief labour but for the general improvements
            of the country and financed from general revenue. Unproductive works may also be
            financed from Loan Funds but in this case it is important that the State Government
            should make provision for a sinking fund to extinguished the loan (usually within a
            generation) in accordance with such rules as may be prescribed by the President from
            time to time.

        <para_desc>

            The rules for determining (1) whether a work which has been classed as productive shall
            continue to be so classed, and (2) whether an unproductive work may be, reclassed as
            productive, are as follows, the percentage rates referred to being those prescribed for
            the time being and being subject to alterations at the discretion of the President:
            (i) Every irrigation, navigation, embankment or drainage work for which capital accounts
            are kept should, until ten years after the date of the closure of its construction
            estimate, be classed as productive if the net revenue anticipated from it appears likely
            to repay, on the expiry of that periods the annual interest charges on the capital
            invested (including direct and indirect charges and arrears of simple interest)
            calculated at 4 ½ per cent in the case of works sanctioned before 1st April, 1937, at 4%
            in the case of those sanctioned between 1st April, 1937 and 1st April, 1941, at 5 per
            cent in the case of those sanctioned between 1st April, 1941 and 1st April, 1946, and at
            4 per cent in the case of those sanctioned on or after 1st April 1946. Conversely if it
            is not expected to yield the relevant return, it should be classed as unproductive. If,
            moreover, at any time during the period of construction, or within ten years of the date
            of the closure of its construction estimate, it becomes apparent that a work originally
            classed as productive will not actually be remunerative according to the criterion
            prescribed above it should be transferred from the productive to the unproductive class,
            and similarly if it becomes obvious, during the same period that a work sanctioned as
            unproductive will actually prove remunerative, the transfer of the work from the
            unproductive to the productive class may be effected.
            (ii) Every work classified in accordance with Rule (i) above will retain its
            classification unchanged during the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth years after the
            closure of its construction estimate.
            (iii) If any irrigation, navigation, embankment or drainage work for which a capital
            account is kept and which is classed as productive fails, at any time after the expiry
            of ten years from the date of the closure of its construction estimate, in three
            successive years to yield the relevant return prescribed in Rule (i) above, it should be
            transferred to the unproductive class. A work classed as unproductive which succeeds in
            yielding, in three successive years, the relevant return prescribed for a productive
            work may, on the same principle be transferred to the productive class.
            (iv) If an existing irrigation, navigation, embankment or drainage work be extended or
            improved, the criterion of productivity prescribed in Rules (i) to (iii) above shall be
            applied to the whole system, including such extension or improvement, as if the
            extension or improvement had been executed simultaneously with the original work, and
            the date of sanction referred to in those rules for the purpose of determining the
            percentage to be returned by the system as a whole, shall be that of the accord of
            sanction to the original project. As an exception to this rule if any extension be,
            owing either to its nature or magnitude such as may reasonably be considered to be a
            separate project and if it be susceptible of having clear Capital and Revenue accounts
            kept of it, as distinct from those of the project as a whole, it should be treated as
            separate project and in that case, the conditions relating to original projects and not
            those relating to extensions and improvement shall be applicable. In all such cases,
            separate Capital and Revenue accounts should be maintained for the extension in order to
            enable the productive test to be periodically applied.

            (v) Rules (i), (iii) and (iv) are, however, subject to the proviso that the State
            Government may postpone the transfer of a work from one class to the other in cases in
            which it is satisfied that its success or failure is due to purely transient causes.

            Irrigation and navigation works are generally of a revenue producing character. Large
            works being usually financed from borrowed money, it is essential to see how they are
            working and for this purpose a Capital and Revenue account has to be maintained showing
            the total cost of construction, extensions and improvements, as well as the gross
            revenue and the cost of working and of maintenance.

        <para_desc>

            The principles to be observed in deciding whether an item of expenditure should be
            charged to Capital or to Revenue are as follows
            (a) Capital bears all charges for the first construction and equipment of a project, as
            well as charges for maintenance on sections not opened for working and charges for such
            subsequent additions and improvements as may be sanctioned under the rules by competent
            authority.
            (b) Revenue bears all charges for maintenance and working expenses, which embrace all
            expenditure for the working and upkeep of the project as also for replacements and for
            minor additions or improvements, as it may be considered desirable to charge to Revenue
            instead of increasing the capital cost of the undertaking.
            (c) In the case of renewals and replacements of existing works if the cost really
            represents an increase in the capital value of the system and exceeds the cost of the
            original work by Rs. 1,000 the cost of the new work should be divided between Capital
            and Revenue the portion debited to the latter account being the cost of the original
            work, which should be estimated if the actual cost is not known, and the balance charged
            to capital. In other cases, the whole cost of the new work should be charged to Revenue.
            Thus, a renewal which does not represent a substantial improvement, of the original
            works but which is in all material essentials the same as the latter, although it may
            exceed the cost of that work by more than Rs. 1,000 should not be charged to Capital but
            to Revenue Account.
            (d) When the construction estimate of a project for which a separate Capital account is
            kept is closed, the expenditure on works of extensions will be charged thus
            (i) Estimates exceeding Rs. 1,000 for (1) works which are in themselves directly
            remunerative, such as new distributaries, mills or works for increasing the canal
            discharge, and (2) works which are necessary for the full development of a project, but
            which are not in themselves directly remunerative shall be charged to the Capital
            account.
            (ii) Estimates amounting to Rs. 1,000 or under shall be charged to the Revenue account
            under extensions and improvements.
            (iii) All estimates for works which are neither renumerative in themselves for
            considered necessary for the development of the project shall be charged to the Revenue
            account under extensions and improvements.
            (e) Where outlay is of a nature under these rules does not appertain to Capital, it is
            not, under any circumstances and whatever its magnitude to be charged to Capital.

            the Executive Engineer and the Collector concerned on the technical and revenue aspects
            respectively wherever feasible and be submitted to the Chief Engineer who in cases where
            he modifies the schemes, may obtain the views of the Collector on the modified schemes
            and submit them to the Government through the Board of Revenue, whose function will only
            be to go into the financial aspects and any other matter brought to its notice by the
            Collector.
            Note:- In all the above cases, the Collector should particularly consider the point
            whether distribution of water or ryots’ interests are affected by the scheme.

            The preliminary investigation of a project by the Public Works Department should be
            limited to the collection, by inspection preliminary field work and enquiry, of the data
            required for arriving at an approximate estimate of cost and at a decision whether the
            project is likely to be feasible and should be further investigated with a view to its
            eventual execution. The report on the preliminary investigation should include a general
            description of the proposed work and an approximate estimate of the cost of the project
            and if the complete investigation of the project is recommended a general description of
            the line of the investigations to be made and an estimate of their cost considering the
            work to be done in all the departments concerned and not only in the Public Works
            Department.
            The following points should be dealt with particularly in the report
            (a) The amount of water available, having regard, when necessary, to the possible claims
            of other States to the interest of existing irrigation under the source proposed to be
            tapped whether in this or in the other State and to the rights of other riparian owners
            of Lands Irrigated Lower down;
            (b) the approximate extent of the ayacut of the project and its general location;
            (c) the existing sources of irrigation in the proposed ayacut (e.g., tanks, old wells),
            the suitability of the soil for irrigation;
            (d) the rainfall and its distribution throughout the year;
            (e) the level of sub-soil water at various seasons as indicated by wells in the proposed
            ayacut;

            head-works and the allowance made for seepage and evaporation in the channels;
            (g) a description of the distributory channel in which, in the case of larger works,
            should be accompanied by a longitudinal section;
            (h) any measure which may be necessary for the protection of the ayacut from floods from
            outside it, such as river flood banks;
            (i) the existing drainage facilities in the ayacut and the works to be undertaken;
            (1) to ensure that the drainage courses are made sufficient to carry off not only the
            floods which occur from time to time owing to local rainfall but also the additional
            water which will be placed on the land by the proposed project;

            (2) to enable the drainage water from the fields in the ayacut to reach the drainage
            courses without having to pass over cultivated land for an under length;
            (j) the adequacy of the existing communications and the provisions of additional
            communications and the agency by which they should be provided;
            (k) a rough estimate of the cost of special staff in the various departments concerned
            (1) for making a complete investigation,
            (2) for carrying out the works; and
            (3) for expenditing the development of irrigation after the works are completed.
            (I) the sources from which labour can be obtained;
            (m) a description of the healthiness of the tract in which the works are to be carried
            out and the need for and cost of special measures to safeguard the health of those to be
            employed on the construction of the works, and of housing accommodation and other
            amenities for them.
            In the case of a storage work the report should include
            (n) a general description of the catchment;
            (o) the run-off at the site of the proposed reservoir with data on which the available
            supplies are calculated;
            (p) the approximate capacity of the reservoir;
            (q) a general description of the soil and sub-soil of its bed in porosity of the bed;
            (r) the materials of which it is proposed to construct dam;
            (s). a longitudinal section and a few cross-sections of the dam with sketches of the
            profiles proposed for adoption;
            (t) a general description of the soil and sub-soil at the site of the proposed dam and
            their porosity, the suitability of the foundation of the proposed dam and the
            possibility of leakage under it or round its flanks;
            (u) the proposed surplus works;
            (v) the materials required and those available for the construction and the localities
            from which they can be obtained; and
            (w) a recommendation whether an examination of the site by a geological expert is
            necessary or not.
            The report should also include a preliminary financial forecast including an estimate of
            the rate of water cess, which will have to be charged in order to make the project
            remunerative. Provision being made for the acquisition of land and the execution of
            channels at the cost of Government for large blocks of land for any works that may be
            necessary to ensure adequate protection from floods and drainage of the land to be
            irrigated. The ryots of all land within each district block of such extent not exceeding
            100 acres as prescribed in Andhra Pradesh Irrigation (Construction and Maintenance of
            Water Courses) Act, 1965, or any other extent as may be revised from time to time in the
            ayacut of any irrigation work shall be liable to construct for themselves subject to
            such conditions as may be prescribed and maintain at their own cost, water courses
            required for the supply of water to their lands from the distributaries of irrigation
            work for irrigation purposes and for the discharge of waste or surplus water from those
            lands in accordance with such directions as may be issued by irrigation officers.
            If they fail to do it for themselves the irrigation officer, after duly securing the
            land need for the construction of water course in accordance with the procedure
            prescribed in the said Act, shall do it and recover the cost from the beneficiaries. The
            maximum area of a block to which the channel under the proposals made are to be
            excavated at cost of Government and the normal area to be served by a field channel
            should also be given. These should be estimated on the understanding that the Government
            will control the distribution of water only in and from the channels to be excavated and
            maintained at the cost of Government and not from the field channels and that land for
            field channels is acquired by Government only to facilities and expedite the development
            of the project of mitigating the difficulty which ryots may have in obtaining permission
            from upper ryots to the water through or over their land. The preliminary investigation
            should be made in close collaboration, with the local Revenue and Agricultural Officers.
            The opinion of the local Revenue Officers should particularly be obtained as to the
            desirability of necessity of the projected work the fairness of the rate of water cess
            proposed, and the probability of the anticipated financial results being realized. The
            opinion of the local Agricultural Officers should be particularly obtained as to the
            kind of crops that are and could be raised in the area and the suitability of soils and
            the adequacy of their irrigation with the supplies that the project will make available
            as who on the question whether from the economic point of view the ryot could pay for
            such irrigation the rate of water cess proposed; in this connection the cost to the ryot
            of preparing his land for irrigation should be considered. The question whether
            legislation would be necessary to ensure the realization of the water cess at the rate
            proposed should be examined and there should be a definite recommendation on this
            question. The views of the ryots in general on the proposed work and on the proposed
            rate of water cess should also be incorporated in the report. For this purpose, large
            meeting of the leading ryots concerned or the representatives including village officers
            should be convened at Central places in the project area, and the details of the
            benefits of the project should be explained by officers of the three departments to the
            ryots of the area to be benefited by the project. If at any stage of the investigation
            it is considered that the work is not physically or from an Agricultural point of view,
            feasible or that its Cost will be so high as to be unremunerative unless water cess is
            levied at a prohibitive rate or that negotiations should be undertaken first with any
            other Government of that for any other reasons, the orders of Government should be
            obtained before further expenditure is incurred, the investigation should be stopped and
            a report submitted through the Irrigation Development Board to Government for orders,
            whether it should be proceeded with.

            Should it be decided that a complete investigation should be undertaken, a fuller
            investigation of all the points mentioned in Paragraph 390 should be undertaken and
            reports, plans and estimates should be prepared with full details as required under
            Paragraphs 392, 393, 395 and 396 below. Levels must be taken in sufficient details over
            the whole area. The ayacut should be definitely fixed by the Public Works Department and
            Revenue staff on the assumption that all the ryots concerned will agree to have their
            lands included in the ayacut after making the allowance or the reservation, if
            necessary, of land for new roads, village sites or other public purposes. The main and
            minor distributory channels including field channels should be aligned; the occurrence
            of the ryots to the inclusion of their lands in the ayacut and to the proposed rate of
            water-cess should be obtained in the form of written statements or agreements by the
            Revenue Divisional Officer or other Revenue Officer deputed for the purpose to work with
            the Public Works Department, for this purpose, the station of the sluice or pipe through
            which it is proposed that water should be supplied by the Public Works Department for
            the irrigation of each field, the proposed alignment of the field channel and the level
            at which the water will be supplied must be indicated approximately to the ryot
            concerned; several ryots may sign one statement relating to several fields in one
            village, provided it is made clear to which field or fields the signature of each ryot
            relates; should a small group of ryots be generally unwilling to have their lands
            included in the ayacut, the question of including another area in the ayacut instead
            should be considered should there be a general unwillingness on the part of all or a
            great majority of the ryots in the proposed ayacut to agree to the inclusion of their
            lands in the ayacut and to the proposed rate of water-cess, the orders of Government
            should be obtained through the Irrigation Development Board as to whether the
            investigation of the scheme should be proceeded with or not; should there be a general
            desire on the part of the ryots as evidenced by their written statements that the
            project should be carried out or should the Government order that the investigation be
            proceeded with the ayacut should be definitely fixed by the Public Works Department
            staff and marked in the survey plans, the land of ryots who has expressed unwillingness
            to have their land included in the ayacut being excluded as far as possible and ayacut
            registers should be prepared by village and permanent permits should be tendered to the
            ryots by or in the presence of a gazetted officer of the Public Works or Revenue
            Department. Should any ryot refuse to accept a permit, when tendered, the permit should
            be cancelled and the land excluded from the ayacut register and other land should, if
            possible, be substituted for it in the proposed ayacut. When the ayacut is finally
            settled the alignment of canals, and distributaries and field channels should be
            revised, if necessary, the cost of all main canals and branch channels exceeding 20
            miles in length should be estimated in detail; the cost of other typical branch channels
            and distributaries should be estimated so as to obtain an average rate per mile of
            distributary which can be applied to other branch channels and distributaries, the cost
            of which is not estimated in such detail. During the investigation, land plans and
            scheduled for lands to be acquired for channels, etc., may be prepared and preliminary
            notifications under the Land Acquisition Act may be issued, but care should be taken to
            see that no measures are adopted which would actually commit the Government to the
            expenditure of money on the execution of the project. The sites of bridges over
            irrigation canals, etc., should be settled in consultation with the Zilla Parishads,
            Panchayat Samithis and Panchayats. The Chief markets for the agricultural products of
            the district as well as the existing trade routes and railways should be enumerated and
            definite proposals made as to the additional communications and facilities for marketing
            required as well as the agencies by which these should be provided. The report on the
            complete investigation should include a revised financial forecast.
            It is very necessary that the local Public Works Department Officers should exercise
            very careful foresight in framing estimates of the cost of works. It is the duty of the
            Superintending Engineer and Executive Engineer in preparing or scrutinizing an estimate
            to consider carefully the local conditions and the details of the methods by which it is
            proposed to carry out the work and to satisfy himself that the estimate make adequate
            provision for all requirements which can be foreseen. The exercise of special care is
            necessary in the case of estimates for productive work since the decision to proceed
            with them or not must greatly depend on the estimated cost of carrying them out.

            The main headings are as follows
            Direct charges
            1. Works (including surveys and special tools and plant).

            Indirect charges :—Capitalization of abatement of land revenue on area occupied by works
            calculated at twenty years purchase.
            The items included under the head “Works” should be classified under the prescribed main
            and sub-heads of account. The cost of surveys including expenditure incurred, prior to
            the submission of the project, should be included in the estimate.
            Provision should be made in the estimate for establishment tools and plant and
            pensionary charges as follows:
            Establishment :—(Including leave allowances), 25 per cent on the estimated works
            outlay.

            establishment employed on the project and the rates prescribed by the Government from
            time to time for large projects may be adopted.
            (b) In the case of small projects or open capital works which are carried out by the
            regular Public Works Department establishment and which in consequence are debited with
            the prorata charges for establishment calculated under the rules in Appendix 7 to the
            Andhra Pradesh Public Works Account Code, such percentage as may be fixed by the
            Government from time to time on the gross establishment charges.
            Note :— The term “Pensionable Establishment” referred to in (a) above also includes such
            portion of the temporary staff which may be estimated by Government to have the
            likelihood of ultimately being made permanent.
            Provision should also be made in the estimate of a project for which capital and Revenue
            Accounts are kept for the levy of one percent on the estimated works outlay for audit
            although this levy is made only in the proforma accounts of the works and not in the
            regular accounts of the State.
            Note 1 —These orders will take effect from 1st April, 1933. Note 2 :—In the case of
            irrigation projects for which neither Capital nor Revenue accounts are kept, it is
            unnecessary, except in the case of large surveys for new irrigation projects referred to
            in Rule 13 of Appendix 7, Andhra Pradesh Public Works Accounts Code, to enter provision
            for establishment and tools and plant in the estimate unless or any reason, it may be
            deemed desirable to do so in order to forecast the ultimate result of the project.

            V. Contracts :
            To accept any tenders for execution of works, including those to be executed by the

            such percentage excess as the Chief Engineer is competent to sanction under excess over
            estimates. When once a work is administratively sanctioned by the Government and the
            estimate therefore is technically sanctioned by the competent authority and a contract
            is concluded for the execution of the work, no work should be stopped or slowed down
            (rare emergencies expected) or payments to contractors withheld or delayed, even if
            there is need for a revised estimate to be sanctioned by the Government. Such payments
            should however, be subject to the existence of adequate budget provision within the
            relevant head of account. When the expenditure on a work is likely to exceed over the
            10% over the contract value of the work ( in the case of premium tenders), the Chief
            Engineer should inform the Government of the approximate extra commitment involved and
            also follow up with a revised estimate as early as possible. If, however, only a part of
            the work covered by the estimate has been entrusted on contract at premium rates, this
            10% referred to above should be over the total value of the work, comprising the
            contract amount for the portion or portions already entrusted plus the total estimated
            value of the item not yet entrusted or utilized. The Chief Engineer may provisionally
            sanction the revised estimates and submit them to Government for regular sanction before
            the final payment for work is made.

            VI. Write off -- No change

            VII. Law Suits -- No change
